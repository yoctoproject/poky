# Sample bblayers.conf for Yocto builds
# This file lists the layers that BitBake will use during the build
# Copy this to your build/conf/ directory and customize paths as needed

# POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"

# Base directory for build operations
BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"

# Files that BitBake uses to track dependencies

#
# Layer Configuration
#
# Adjust the paths below based on your setup:
# - For bitbake-setup: paths will be relative to your setup directory
# - For manual setup: paths point to your layers/ directory

# Example for manual setup with layers in ../layers/
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-yocto/meta-poky \
  ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
  ##OEROOT##/layers/openembedded-core/meta \
  "

# Alternative example with absolute paths
# Replace /path/to/yocto with your actual workspace path
# BBLAYERS ?= " \
#   /path/to/yocto/layers/meta-yocto/meta-poky \
#   /path/to/yocto/layers/meta-yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
#   /path/to/yocto/layers/openembedded-core/meta \
#   "

#
# Additional Layers
#
# Add additional layers here as needed. Common layers include:
#
# OpenEmbedded layers (meta-openembedded):
# BBLAYERS += " \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-networking \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
#   "
#
# Qt layer:
# BBLAYERS += "##OEROOT##/layers/meta-qt5"
#
# Security layer:
# BBLAYERS += "##OEROOT##/layers/meta-security"
#
# Virtualization layer:
# BBLAYERS += "##OEROOT##/layers/meta-virtualization"
#
# Custom/proprietary layers:
# BBLAYERS += " \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-custom \
#   ##OEROOT##/layers/meta-company \
#   "

#
# Layer Priority Notes
#
# Layers are processed in the order listed in BBLAYERS
# If multiple layers provide the same recipe, the one in the layer with
# higher priority (defined by BBFILE_PRIORITY in layer.conf) wins
#
# You can check layer priorities with:
#   bitbake-layers show-layers

#
# Dynamic Layers
#
# Some layers use dynamic layer support to enable features only when
# dependencies are present. No special configuration needed.

# End of bblayers.conf sample
