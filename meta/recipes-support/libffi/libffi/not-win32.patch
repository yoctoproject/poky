Subject: [PATCH] libffi: ensure sysroot paths are not in libffi.pc

libffi's configure assumes that cross-compiled builds are complicated and
introduces convoluted path manipulation involving gcc search paths to the
install paths, resulting in paths like -L/usr/lib/../lib/ appearing in
libffi.pc.  When pkg-config is then used to obtain the linker flags for libffi
it can't tell that this path is on the default search path and returns
$SYSROOT/usr/lib/../lib which then gets written all over the target sysroot.
This then means the sstate can't be shared and triggers QA errors.

As this block is generally pointless, disable it.
