<title>Getting Started with the Yocto Project</title>

<para>
    This chapter introduces the Yocto Project and gives you an idea of what you need to get started.  
    You can find enough information to set up your development host and build or use images for 
    hardware supported by the Yocto Project by reading  
    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;'>
    The Yocto Project Quick Start</ulink>.

    The remainder of this chapter summarizes what is in the Yocto Project Quick Start and provides 
    some higher-level concepts you might want to consider.

    <title>Introducing the Yocto Project</title>

    <para>
        The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project focused on embedded Linux development.  
        The project currently provides a build system, which is sometimes referred to as "Poky",
        and provides various ancillary tools suitable for the embedded developer.  
        The Yocto Project also features the Sato reference User Interface, which is optimized for 
        stylus driven, low-resolution screens.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can use the Yocto Project, which uses the BitBake build tool, to develop complete Linux 
        images and associated user-space applications for architectures based on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, 
        x86 and x86-64.  
        While the Yocto Project does not provide a strict testing framework,
        it does provide or generate for you artifacts that let you perform target-level and 
        emulated testing and debugging.  
        Additionally, if you are an <trademark class='trade'>Eclipse</trademark>
        IDE user, you can install an Eclipse Yocto Plug-in to allow you to 
        develop within that familiar environment.

    <title>Getting Set Up</title>

    <para>
        Here is what you need to get set up to use the Yocto Project:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Host System:</emphasis>  You should have a reasonably current 
                Linux-based host system.
                You will have the best results with a recent release of Fedora, 
                OpenSUSE, or Ubuntu as these releases are frequently tested against the Yocto Project
                and officially supported.  
                You should also have about 100 gigabytes of free disk space for building images.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Packages:</emphasis>  The Yocto Project requires certain packages
                exist on your development system (e.g. Python 2.6 or 2.7).  
                See "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#packages'>The Packages</ulink>" 
                section in the Yocto Project Quick start for the exact package 
                requirements and the installation commands to install them 
                for the supported distributions.</para></listitem>
            <listitem id='local-yp-release'><para><emphasis>Yocto Project Release:</emphasis>  
                You need a release of the Yocto Project.  
                You can get set up with local 
                <link linkend='yocto-project-files'>Yocto Project Files</link> one of two ways 
                depending on whether you 
                are going to be contributing back into the Yocto Project source repository or not.
                <note>
                    Regardless of the method you use, this manual refers to the resulting 
                    hierarchical set of files as the "Yocto Project Files" or the "Yocto Project File
                    Structure."
                </note>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Tarball Extraction:</emphasis>  If you are not going to contribute 
                        back into the Yocto Project, you can simply download the Yocto Project release you want 
                        from the website’s <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;/download'>download page</ulink>.
                        Once you have the tarball, just extract it into a directory of your choice.</para>
                        <para>For example, the following command extracts the Yocto Project &DISTRO; 
                        release tarball 
                        into the current working directory and sets up the Yocto Project file structure
                        with a top-level directory named <filename>&YOCTO_POKY;</filename>:

     $ tar xfj &YOCTO_POKY_TARBALL;
                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>This method does not produce a Git repository. 
                        Instead, you simply end up with a local snapshot of the 
                        Yocto Project files that are based on the particular release in the 
                        tarball.</para></listitem>

                        back into the Yocto Project or you simply want to keep up
                        with the latest developments, you should use Git commands to set up a local
                        Git repository of the Yocto Project Files.
                        Doing so creates a Git repository with a complete history of changes and allows 
                        you to easily submit your changes upstream to the project.
                        Because you cloned the repository, you have access to all the Yocto Project development
                        branches and tag names used in the upstream repository.</para>
                        <para>The following transcript shows how to clone the Yocto Project Files'  
                        Git repository into the current working directory.
                        <note>The name of the Yocto Project Files Git repository in the Yocto Project Files
                        Source Repositories is <filename>poky</filename>.
                        You can view the Yocto Project Source Repositories at

                If you are going to be making modifications to a supported Linux Yocto kernel, you 
                need to establish local copies of the source.
                You can find Git repositories of supported Linux Yocto Kernels organized under
                "Yocto Linux Kernel" in the Yocto Project Source Repositories at
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;/cgit.cgi'></ulink>.</para>
                <para>This setup involves creating a bare clone of the Linux Yocto kernel and then 
                copying that cloned repository.
                You can create the bare clone and the copy of the bare clone anywhere you like.
                For simplicity, it is recommended that you create these structures outside of the 
                Yocto Project Files Git repository.</para>
                <para>As an example, the following transcript shows how to create the bare clone
                of the <filename>linux-yocto-3.2</filename> kernel and then create a copy of 
                that clone.
                <note>When you have a local Linux Yocto kernel Git repository, you can 
                reference that repository rather than the upstream Git repository as 
                part of the <filename>clone</filename> command.
                Doing so can speed up the process.</note></para>
                <para>In the following example, the bare clone is named

                The Yocto Project provides a layer called <filename>meta-intel</filename> and

                <para>Similar considerations exist for setting up the <filename>meta-intel</filename>
                layer.  
                You can get set up for BSP development one of two ways: tarball extraction or
                with a local Git repository.
                It is a good idea to use the same method used to set up the Yocto Project Files.
                Regardless of the method you use, the Yocto Project uses the following BSP layer 
                naming scheme:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'> 
     meta-&lt;BSP_name&gt;

                Here are some examples:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay

                        Again, this method just produces a snapshot of the BSP layer in the form

    <para>
        Another option you have to get started is to use pre-built binaries.  
        This scenario is ideal for developing software applications to run on your target hardware.  
        To do this, you need to install the stand-alone Yocto Project cross-toolchain tarball and 
        then download the pre-built kernel that you will boot in the QEMU emulator.  
        Next, you must download and extract the target root filesystem for your target 
        machine’s architecture.  
        Finally, you set up the environment to emulate the hardware and then start the QEMU emulator.
