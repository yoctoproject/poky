    <title>Introducing the Yocto Project</title>

    <para>
        The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project focused on embedded Linux development.  
        The project currently provides a build system, which is sometimes referred to as "Poky",
        and provides various ancillary tools suitable for the embedded developer.  
        The Yocto Project also features the Sato reference User Interface, which is optimized for 
        stylus driven, low-resolution screens.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can use the Yocto Project, which uses the BitBake build tool, to develop complete Linux 
        images and associated user-space applications for architectures based on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, 
        x86 and x86-64.  
        While the Yocto Project does not provide a strict testing framework,
        it does provide or generate for you artifacts that let you perform target-level and 
        emulated testing and debugging.  
        And, if you are an <trademark class='trade'>Eclipse</trademark>
        IDE user, you can install an Eclipse Yocto Plug-in to allow you to 
        develop within that familiar environment.

    <title>Getting Setup</title>

    <para>
        Here is what you need to get set up to use the Yocto Project:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Host System:</emphasis>  You should have a reasonably current 
                Linux-based host system.
                You will have the best results with a recent release of Fedora, 
                OpenSUSE, or Ubuntu as these releases are frequently tested against the Yocto Project
                and officially supported.  
                You should also have about 100 gigabytes of free disk space for building images.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Packages:</emphasis>  The Yocto Project requires certain packages
                exist on your development system (e.g. Python 2.6 or 2.7).  
                See "<ulink url='http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/1.1/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html#packages'>The Packages</ulink>" 
                section in the Yocto Project Quick start for the exact package 
                requirements and the installation commands to install them 
                for the supported distributions.</para></listitem>
            <listitem id='local-yp-release'><para><emphasis>Yocto Project Release:</emphasis>  
                You need a release of the Yocto Project.  
                You can get set up with local Yocto Project files one of two ways depending on whether you 
                are going to be contributing back into the Yocto Project source repository or not.
                <note>
                    Regardless of the method you use, this manual refers to the resulting 
                    hierarchical set of files as "the Yocto Project files" or "the Yocto Project file
                    structure."
                </note>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Tarball Extraction:</emphasis>  If you are not going to contribute 
                        back into the Yocto Project, you can simply download the Yocto Project release you want 
                        from the website’s <ulink url='http://yoctoproject.org/download'>download page</ulink>.
                        Once you have the tarball, just extract it into a directory of your choice.</para>
                        <para>For example, the following command extracts the Yocto Project 1.1 release tarball 
                        into the current working directory and sets up the Yocto Project file structure
                        with a top-level directory named <filename>poky-1.1</filename>:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ tar xfj poky-edison-6.0.tar.bz2
                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>This method does not produce a Git repository. 
                        Instead, you simply end up with a local snapshot of the 
                        Yocto Project files that are based on the particular release in the 
                        tarball.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Git Repository Method:</emphasis>  If you are going to be contributing
                        back into the Yocto Project, you should use Git commands to set up a local 
                        Git repository of the Yocto Project files.  
                        Doing so creates a Git repository with a complete history of changes and allows 
                        you to easily submit your changes upstream to the project.</para>
                       <para>The following transcript shows how to clone the Yocto Project files'  
                       Git repository into the current working directory.  
                       The command creates the repository in a directory named <filename>poky</filename>.
                       For information on the Yocto Project and Git, see the
                       "<link linkend='git'>Git</link>" section.

            <listitem id='local-kernel-files'><para><emphasis>Linux Yocto Kernel:</emphasis>  
                If you are going to be making modifications to a supported Linux Yocto kernel, you 
                need to establish local copies of the source.
                This setup involves creating a bare clone of the Linux Yocto kernel and then cloning 
                that repository.
                You can create the bare clone and the copy of the bare clone anywhere you like.
                For simplicity, it is recommended that you create these structures outside of the 
                Yocto Project files' Git repository.</para>
                <para>As an example, the following transcript shows how to create the bare clone
                of the <filename>linux-yocto-3.0</filename> kernel and then create a copy of 
                that clone.
                <note>When you have a local Linux Yocto kernel Git repository, you can 
                reference that repository rather than the upstream Git repository as 
                part of the <filename>clone</filename> command.
                Doing so can speed up the process.</note>
                In the following example, the bare clone is named 
                <filename>linux-yocto-3.0.git</filename>, while the 
                copy is named <filename>linux-yocto-3.0</filename>:

                <para>Now create a clone of the bare clone just created:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ git clone linux-yocto-3.0.git linux-yocto-3.0

            <listitem id='poky-extras-repo'><para><emphasis>
                The <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git Repository</emphasis>:
                The <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git repository contains metadata needed to 
                build the kernel image.
                In particular, it contains the kernel <filename>.bbappend</filename> files that you 
                edit to point to your locally modified kernel source files and to build the kernel
                image. 
                Pointing to these local files is much more efficient than requiring a download of the 
                source files from upstream each time you make changes to the kernel.</para>
                <para>It is good practice to create this Git repository inside the Yocto Project
                files Git repository.
                Following is an example that creates the <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git 
                repository inside the Yocto Project files Git repository, which is named 
                <filename>poky</filename> in this case:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky
     $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky-extras poky-extras

           <listitem><para><emphasis>Supported Board Support Packages (BSPs):</emphasis>  
                Similar considerations exist for BSPs.  
                You can get set up for BSP development one of two ways: tarball extraction or
                with a local Git repository.
                Regardless of the method you use, the Yocto Project uses the following BSP layer 
                naming scheme:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'> 
     meta-&lt;BSP_name&gt; 
                </literallayout>
                where &lt;BSP_name&gt; is the recognized BSP name.
                Here are some examples:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay
     meta-emenlow
     meta-n450
                </literallayout>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Tarball Extraction:</emphasis>  You can download any released 
                        BSP tarball from the same

                        to get the Yocto Project release.  
                        Once you have the tarball, just extract it into a directory of your choice.
                        Again, this method just produces a snapshot of the BSP layer in the form
                        of a hierarchical directory structure.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Git Repository Method:</emphasis>  If you are working 
                        with a Yocto Project files Git repository, you should also set up a

                        Typically, you set up the <filename>meta-intel</filename> Git repository inside

    <title>Using Pre-Built Binaries and QEMU</title>

    <para>
        Another option you have to get started is to use pre-built binaries.  
        This scenario is ideal for developing software applications to run on your target hardware.  
        To do this, you need to install the stand-alone Yocto Project cross-toolchain tarball and 
        then download the pre-built kernel that you will boot in the QEMU emulator.  
        Next, you must download and extract the target root filesystem for your target 
        machine’s architecture.  
        Finally, you set up the environment to emulate the hardware and then start the QEMU emulator.
    </para>
