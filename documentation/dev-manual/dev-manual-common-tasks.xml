<title>Common Tasks</title>
    <para>
        This chapter describes standard tasks such as adding new
        software packages, extending or customizing images, and porting work to
        new hardware (adding a new machine).
        The chapter also describes how to combine multiple
        versions of library files into a single image, how to handle a package name alias, and
        gives advice about how to make changes to the Yocto Project to achieve the best results.

        <title>Understanding and Creating Layers</title>

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system supports organizing <link linkend='metadata'>metadata</link>
            into multiple layers.
            Layers allow you to isolate different types of customizations from each other.
            You might find it tempting to keep everything in one layer when working on a single project.
            However, the more modular you organize your metadata, the easier it is to cope with future changes.
        </para>

        <para>
            To illustrate how layers are used to keep things modular, consider machine customizations.
            These types of customizations typically reside in a BSP Layer.
            Furthermore, the machine customizations should be isolated from recipes and metadata that support
            a new GUI environment, for example.
            This situation gives you a couple of layers: one for the machine configurations, and one for the
            GUI environment.
            It is important to understand, however, that the BSP layer can still make machine-specific
            additions to recipes within the GUI environment layer without polluting the GUI layer itself
            with those machine-specific changes.
            You can accomplish this through a recipe that is a BitBake append
            (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) file, which is described later in this section.
        </para>

            <title>Layers</title>

            <para>
                The Source Directory contains several layers right out of the box.
                You can easily identify a layer in the Source Directory by its folder name.
                Folders that are layers begin with the string <filename>meta</filename>.
                For example, when you set up the <link linkend='source-directory'>Source Directory</link>
                structure, you will see several layers: <filename>meta</filename>,
                <filename>meta-hob</filename>, <filename>meta-skeleton</filename>,
                <filename>meta-yocto</filename>, and <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename>.
                Each of these folders is a layer.
            </para>

            <para>
                Furthermore, if you set up a local copy of the <filename>meta-intel</filename> Git repository
                and then explore that folder, you will discover many BSP layers within the
                <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer.
                For more information on BSP layers, see the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-layers'>BSP Layers</ulink>"
                section in the Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide.

            <title>Creating Your Own Layer</title>

            <para>
                It is very easy to create your own layer to use with the OpenEmbedded build system.
                Follow these general steps to create your layer:
                <orderedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Check Existing Layers:</emphasis> Before creating a new layer,
                        you should be sure someone has not already created a layer containing the metadata
                        you need.
                        You can see the
                        <ulink url='&OE_HOME_URL;/wiki/LayerIndex'><filename>LayerIndex</filename></ulink>
                        for a list of layers from the OpenEmbedded community that can be used in the
                        Yocto Project.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Create a Directory:</emphasis> Create the directory
                        for your layer.
                        Traditionally, prepend the name of the folder with the string
                        <filename>meta</filename>.
                        For example:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-mylayer
     meta-GUI_xyz
     meta-mymachine

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Create a Layer Configuration File:</emphasis> Inside your new
                       layer folder, you need to create a <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file.
                       It is easiest to take an existing layer configuration file and copy that to your
                       layer's <filename>conf</filename> directory and then modify the file as needed.</para>
                       <para>The <filename>meta-yocto/conf/layer.conf</filename> file demonstrates the
                       required syntax:
                       <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # We have a conf and classes directory, add to BBPATH
     BBPATH := "${LAYERDIR}:${BBPATH}"

     # We have recipes-* directories, add to BBFILES
     BBFILES := "${BBFILES} ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
                 ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"

     BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "yocto"
     BBFILE_PATTERN_yocto := "^${LAYERDIR}/"
     BBFILE_PRIORITY_yocto = "5"
                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>In the previous example, the recipes for the layers are added to
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBFILES'>BBFILES</ulink></filename>.
                        The
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBFILE_COLLECTIONS'>BBFILE_COLLECTIONS</ulink></filename>
                        variable is then appended with the layer name.
                        The
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBFILE_PATTERN'>BBFILE_PATTERN</ulink></filename>
                        variable is set to a regular expression and is used to match files
                        from <filename>BBFILES</filename> into a particular layer.
                        In this case, immediate expansion of
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LAYERDIR'>LAYERDIR</ulink></filename>
                        sets <filename>BBFILE_PATTERN</filename> to the layer's path.
                        The
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBFILE_PRIORITY'>BBFILE_PRIORITY</ulink></filename>
                        variable then assigns a priority to the layer.
                        Applying priorities is useful in situations where the same package might appear in multiple
                        layers and allows you to choose what layer should take precedence.</para>
                        <para>Note the use of the
                        <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LAYERDIR'>LAYERDIR</ulink></filename>
                        variable with the immediate expansion operator.
                        The <filename>LAYERDIR</filename> variable expands to the directory of the current layer and
                        requires the immediate expansion operator so that BitBake does not wait to expand the variable
                        when it's parsing a different directory.</para>
                        <para>Through the use of the <filename>BBPATH</filename> variable,
                        BitBake locates <filename>.bbclass</filename> files, configuration
                        files, and files that are included with <filename>include</filename>
                        and <filename>require</filename> statements.
                        For these cases, BitBake uses the first file with the matching name found in
                        <filename>BBPATH</filename>.
                        This is similar to the way the <filename>PATH</filename> variable is used for binaries.
                        We recommend, therefore, that you use unique <filename>.bbclass</filename>
                        and configuration file names in your custom layer.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Add Content:</emphasis> Depending on the type of layer,
                        add the content.
                        If the layer adds support for a machine, add the machine configuration in
                        a <filename>conf/machine/</filename> file within the layer.
                        If the layer adds distro policy, add the distro configuration in a
                        <filename>conf/distro/</filename> file with the layer.
                        If the layer introduces new recipes, put the recipes you need in
                        <filename>recipes-*</filename> subdirectories within the layer.
                        <note>In order to be compliant with the Yocto Project, a layer must contain
                            a <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-filelayout-readme'>README file.</ulink>

            </para>

            <para>
                To create layers that are easier to maintain, you should consider the following:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>Avoid "overlaying" entire recipes from other layers in your
                        configuration.
                        In other words, don't copy an entire recipe into your layer and then modify it.
                        Use <filename>.bbappend</filename> files to override the parts of the
                        recipe you need to modify.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>Avoid duplicating include files.
                        Use <filename>.bbappend</filename> files for each recipe that uses an include
                        file.
                        Or, if you are introducing a new recipe that requires the included file, use the
                        path relative to the original layer directory to refer to the file.
                        For example, use <filename>require recipes-core/somepackage/somefile.inc</filename>
                        instead of <filename>require somefile.inc</filename>.
                        If you're finding you have to overlay the include file, it could indicate a
                        deficiency in the include file in the layer to which it originally belongs.
                        If this is the case, you need to address that deficiency instead of overlaying
                        the include file.
                        For example, consider how Qt 4 database support plug-ins are configured.
                        The Source Directory does not have
                        MySQL or PostgreSQL, however OpenEmbedded's
                        layer <filename>meta-oe</filename> does.
                        Consequently, <filename>meta-oe</filename> uses <filename>.bbappend</filename>
                        files to modify the <filename>QT_SQL_DRIVER_FLAGS</filename> variable to enable
                        the appropriate plugins.
                        This variable was added to the <filename>qt4.inc</filename> include file in
                        the Source Directory specifically to allow the <filename>meta-oe</filename> layer
                        to be able to control which plugins are built.</para></listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>

            <para>
                We also recommend the following:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>Store custom layers in a Git repository that uses the
                        <filename>meta-&lt;layer_name&gt;</filename> format.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>Clone the repository alongside other <filename>meta</filename>

                 </itemizedlist>
                 Following these recommendations keeps your Source Directory and
                 its configuration entirely inside the Yocto Project's core base.

        <section id='enabling-your-layer'>
            <title>Enabling Your Layer</title>

            <para>
                Before the OpenEmbedded build system can use your new layer, you need to enable it.
                To enable your layer, simply add your layer's path to the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBLAYERS'>BBLAYERS</ulink></filename>
                variable in your <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file, which is found in the
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>.
                The following example shows how to enable a layer named <filename>meta-mylayer</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LCONF_VERSION = "6"

     BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
     BBFILES ?= ""

            </para>

            <para>
                BitBake parses each <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file as specified in the
                <filename>BBLAYERS</filename> variable within the <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename>
                file.
                During the processing of each <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file, BitBake adds the
                recipes, classes and configurations contained within the particular layer to the source
                directory.
            </para>

        <section id='using-bbappend-files'>
            <title>Using .bbappend Files</title>

            <para>
                Recipes used to append metadata to other recipes are called BitBake append files.
                BitBake append files use the <filename>.bbappend</filename> file type suffix, while
                the corresponding recipes to which metadata is being appended use the
                <filename>.bb</filename> file type suffix.
            </para>

            <para>
                A <filename>.bbappend</filename> file allows your layer to make additions or
                changes to the content of another layer's recipe without having to copy the other
                recipe into your layer.
                Your <filename>.bbappend</filename> file resides in your layer, while the underlying
                <filename>.bb</filename> recipe file to which you are appending metadata
                resides in a different layer.
            </para>

            <para>
                Append files files must have the same name as the corresponding recipe.
                For example, the append file <filename>someapp_&DISTRO;.bbappend</filename> must
                apply to <filename>someapp_&DISTRO;.bb</filename>.
                This means the original recipe and append file names are version number specific.
                If the corresponding recipe is renamed to update to a newer version, the
                underlying <filename>.bbappend</filename> file must be renamed as well.
                During the build process, BitBake displays an error on starting if it detects a
                <filename>.bbappend</filename> file that does not have a corresponding recipe
                with a matching name.
            </para>

            <para>
                Being able to append information to an existing recipe not only avoids duplication,
                but also automatically applies recipe changes in a different layer to your layer.
                If you were copying recipes, you would have to manually merge changes as they occur.
            </para>

            <para>

                </literallayout>
                This example adds or overrides files in
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                within a <filename>.bbappend</filename> by extending the path BitBake uses to search for files.
                The most reliable way to do this is by prepending the
                <filename>FILESEXTRAPATHS</filename> variable.
                For example, if you have your files in a directory that is named the same as your package
                (<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PN'><filename>PN</filename></ulink>),
                you can add this directory by adding the following to your <filename>.bbappend</filename> file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
                </literallayout>
                Using the immediate expansion assignment operator <filename>:=</filename> is important because
                of the reference to <filename>THISDIR</filename>.
                The trailing colon character is important as it ensures that items in the list remain
                colon-separated.
                <note>BitBake automatically defines the <filename>THISDIR</filename> variable.
                    You should never set this variable yourself.
                    Using <filename>_prepend</filename> ensures your path will be searched prior to other
                    paths in the final list.

            <para>
                Each layer is assigned a priority value.
                Priority values control which layer takes precedence if there are recipe files with
                the same name in multiple layers.
                For these cases, the recipe file from the layer with a higher priority number taking precedence.
                Priority values also affect the order in which multiple <filename>.bbappend</filename> files
                for the same recipe are applied.
                You can either specify the priority manually, or allow the build system to calculate it
                based on the layer's dependencies.
            </para>

            <para>

                                However, if there are appended or changed variable values, you need to tidy
                                these up yourself.
                                Consider the following example.
                                Here, the <filename>bitbake-layers</filename> command adds the line

     ...
     DESCRIPTION = "A useful utility"

                                Ideally, you would tidy up these utilities as follows:

            You can customize images to satisfy particular requirements.

            <para>
                One way to get additional software into an image is to create a custom image.
                The following example shows the form for the two lines you need:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL = "packagegroup-core-x11-base package1 package2"

     inherit core-image
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                By creating a custom image, a developer has total control
                over the contents of the image.
                It is important to use the correct names of packages in the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'>IMAGE_INSTALL</ulink></filename>
                variable.
                You must use the OpenEmbedded notation and not the Debian notation for the names
                (e.g. <filename>eglibc-dev</filename> instead of <filename>libc6-dev</filename>).
            </para>

            <para>
                The other method for creating a custom image is to base it on an existing image.
                For example, if you want to create an image based on <filename>core-image-sato</filename>
                but add the additional package <filename>strace</filename> to the image,
                copy the <filename>meta/recipes-sato/images/core-image-sato.bb</filename> to a
                new <filename>.bb</filename> and add the following line to the end of the copy:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL += "strace"
                </literallayout>

        <section id='usingpoky-extend-customimage-customtasks'>
            <title>Customizing Images Using Custom Package Groups</title>

            <para>
                For complex custom images, the best approach is to create a custom package group recipe
                that is used to build the image or images.
                A good example of a package group recipe is
                <filename>meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-core-boot.bb</filename>.
                The
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGES'>PACKAGES</ulink></filename>
                variable lists the package group packages you wish to produce. <filename>inherit packagegroup</filename>
                sets appropriate default values and automatically adds <filename>-dev</filename>
                and <filename>-dbg</filename> complementary
                packages for every package specified in <filename>PACKAGES</filename>.
                Note that the inherit line should be towards
                the top of the recipe, certainly before you set <filename>PACKAGES</filename>.
                For each package you specify in <filename>PACKAGES</filename>, you can use
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'>RDEPENDS</ulink></filename>
                and
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RRECOMMENDS'>RRECOMMENDS</ulink></filename>
                entries to provide a list of packages the parent task package should contain.
                Following is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DESCRIPTION = "My Custom Package Groups"

     inherit packagegroup

     PACKAGES = "\
         packagegroup-custom-apps \
         packagegroup-custom-tools \
         "

     RDEPENDS_packagegroup-custom-apps = "\
         dropbear \
         portmap \

     RRECOMMENDS_packagegroup-custom-tools = "\
         kernel-module-oprofile"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                In the previous example, two package group packages are created with their dependencies and their
                recommended package dependencies listed: <filename>packagegroup-custom-apps</filename>, and
                <filename>packagegroup-custom-tools</filename>.
                To build an image using these package group packages, you need to add
                <filename>packagegroup-custom-apps</filename> and/or
                <filename>packagegroup-custom-tools</filename> to

                variable and then maps that into a set of tasks or packages.

                Users can add extra features by extending the class or creating a custom class for use
                with specialized image <filename>.bb</filename> files.
                You can also add more features by configuring the

                variable in the <filename>local.conf</filename> file found in the Source Directory

            <para>
                The Yocto Project ships with two SSH servers you can use in your images:
                Dropbear and OpenSSH.
                Dropbear is a minimal SSH server appropriate for resource-constrained environments,
                while OpenSSH is a well-known standard SSH server implementation.
                By default, the <filename>core-image-sato</filename> image is configured to use Dropbear.
                The <filename>core-image-basic</filename> and <filename>core-image-lsb</filename>
                images both include OpenSSH.
                The <filename>core-image-minimal</filename> image does not contain an SSH server.
                To change these defaults, edit the <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> variable
                so that it sets the image you are working with to include
                <filename>ssh-server-dropbear</filename> or <filename>ssh-server-openssh</filename>.

            <title>Customizing Images Using <filename>local.conf</filename></title>

            <para>
                It is possible to customize image contents by using variables from your
                local configuration in your <filename>conf/local.conf</filename> file.
                Because it is limited to local use, this method generally only allows you to
                add packages and is not as flexible as creating your own customized image.
                When you add packages using local variables this way, you need to realize that
                these variable changes affect all images at the same time and might not be
                what you require.
            </para>

            <para>
                The simplest way to add extra packages to all images is by using the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'>IMAGE_INSTALL</ulink></filename>
                variable with the <filename>_append</filename> operator:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " strace"
                </literallayout>
                Use of the syntax is important.
                Specifically, the space between the quote and the package name, which is
                <filename>strace</filename> in this example.
                This space is required since the <filename>_append</filename>
                operator does not add the space.
            </para>

            <para>
                Furthermore, you must use <filename>_append</filename> instead of the <filename>+=</filename>
                operator if you want to avoid ordering issues.
                The reason for this is because doing so unconditionally appends to the variable and
                avoids ordering problems due to the variable being set in image recipes and
                <filename>.bbclass</filename> files with operators like <filename>?=</filename>.
                Using <filename>_append</filename> ensures the operation takes affect.
            </para>

            <para>
                As shown in its simplest use, <filename>IMAGE_INSTALL_append</filename> affects
                all images.
                It is possible to extend the syntax so that the variable applies to a specific image only.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append_pn-core-image-minimal = " strace"

            To add a package you need to write a recipe for it.
            Writing a recipe means creating a <filename>.bb</filename> file that sets some
            variables.
            For information on variables that are useful for recipes and for information about recipe naming
            issues, see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-varlocality-recipe-required'>Required</ulink>"
            section of the Yocto Project Reference Manual.
        </para>

        <para>
            Before writing a recipe from scratch, it is often useful to check
            whether someone else has written one already.
            OpenEmbedded is a good place to look as it has a wider scope and range of packages.
            Because the Yocto Project aims to be compatible with OpenEmbedded, most recipes
            you find there should work for you.
        </para>

        <para>
            For new packages, the simplest way to add a recipe is to base it on a similar
            pre-existing recipe.
            The sections that follow provide some examples that show how to add standard
            types of packages.

                Building an application from a single file that is stored locally (e.g. under
                <filename>files/</filename>) requires a recipe that has the file listed in

                Additionally, you need to manually write the <filename>do_compile</filename> and

        <para>
            Adding a new machine to the Yocto Project is a straightforward process.
            This section provides information that gives you an idea of the changes you must make.
            The information covers adding machines similar to those the Yocto Project already supports.
            Although well within the capabilities of the Yocto Project, adding a totally new architecture
            might require
            changes to <filename>gcc/eglibc</filename> and to the site information, which is
            beyond the scope of this manual.
        </para>

        <para>
            For a complete example that shows how to add a new machine,

            <title>Adding the Machine Configuration File</title>

            <para>
                To add a machine configuration you need to add a <filename>.conf</filename> file
                with details of the device being added to the <filename>conf/machine/</filename> file.
                The name of the file determines the name the OpenEmbedded build system
                uses to reference the new machine.

            <title>Adding a Kernel for the Machine</title>

            <para>
                The OpenEmbedded build system needs to be able to build a kernel for the machine.
                You need to either create a new kernel recipe for this machine, or extend an
                existing recipe.
                You can find several kernel examples in the
                Source Directory at <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/linux</filename>
                that you can use as references.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you are creating a new recipe, normal recipe-writing rules apply for setting
                up a
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'>SRC_URI</ulink></filename>.
                Thus, you need to specify any necessary patches and set
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'>S</ulink></filename> to point at the source code.
                You need to create a <filename>configure</filename> task that configures the
                unpacked kernel with a defconfig.
                You can do this by using a <filename>make defconfig</filename> command or,
                more commonly, by copying in a suitable <filename>defconfig</filename> file and and then running
                <filename>make oldconfig</filename>.
                By making use of <filename>inherit kernel</filename> and potentially some of the
                <filename>linux-*.inc</filename> files, most other functionality is
                centralized and the the defaults of the class normally work well.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you are extending an existing kernel, it is usually a matter of adding a
                suitable defconfig file.
                The file needs to be added into a location similar to defconfig files
                used for other machines in a given kernel.
                A possible way to do this is by listing the file in the
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> and adding the machine to the expression in
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-COMPATIBLE_MACHINE'>COMPATIBLE_MACHINE</ulink></filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>

        <section id="platdev-newmachine-formfactor">
            <title>Adding a Formfactor Configuration File</title>

            <para>
                A formfactor configuration file provides information about the
                target hardware for which the image is being built and information that
                the build system cannot obtain from other sources such as the kernel.
                Some examples of information contained in a formfactor configuration file include
                framebuffer orientation, whether or not the system has a keyboard,
                the positioning of the keyboard in relation to the screen, and
                the screen resolution.
            </para>

            <para>
                The build system uses reasonable defaults in most cases, but if customization is
                necessary you need to create a <filename>machconfig</filename> file
                in the <filename>meta/recipes-bsp/formfactor/files</filename>
                directory.
                This directory contains directories for specific machines such as
                <filename>qemuarm</filename> and <filename>qemux86</filename>.

        <title>Combining Multiple Versions of Library Files into One Image</title>

        <para>
            The build system offers the ability to build libraries with different
            target optimizations or architecture formats and combine these together
            into one system image.
            You can link different binaries in the image
            against the different libraries as needed for specific use cases.
            This feature is called "Multilib."
        </para>

        <para>
            An example would be where you have most of a system compiled in 32-bit
            mode using 32-bit libraries, but you have something large, like a database
            engine, that needs to be a 64-bit application and use 64-bit libraries.
            Multilib allows you to get the best of both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.
        </para>

        <para>
            While the Multilib feature is most commonly used for 32 and 64-bit differences,
            the approach the build system uses facilitates different target optimizations.
            You could compile some binaries to use one set of libraries and other binaries
            to use other different sets of libraries.
            The libraries could differ in architecture, compiler options, or other
            optimizations.
        </para>

        <para>
            This section overviews the Multilib process only.
            For more details on how to implement Multilib, see the

            <title>Preparing to use Multilib</title>

            <para>
                User-specific requirements drive the Multilib feature,
                Consequently, there is no one "out-of-the-box" configuration that likely
                exists to meet your needs.
            </para>

            <para>
                In order to enable Multilib, you first need to ensure your recipe is
                extended to support multiple libraries.
                Many standard recipes are already extended and support multiple libraries.
                You can check in the <filename>meta/conf/multilib.conf</filename>
                configuration file in the Source Directory to see how this is
                done using the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBCLASSEXTEND'><filename>BBCLASSEXTEND</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Eventually, all recipes will be covered and this list will be unneeded.
            </para>

            <para>
                For the most part, the Multilib class extension works automatically to
                extend the package name from <filename>${PN}</filename> to
                <filename>${MLPREFIX}${PN}</filename>, where <filename>MLPREFIX</filename>
                is the particular multilib (e.g. "lib32-" or "lib64-").
                Standard variables such as
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DEPENDS'><filename>DEPENDS</filename></ulink>,
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>,

                and <filename>PACKAGES_DYNAMIC</filename> are automatically extended by the system.
                If you are extending any manual code in the recipe, you can use the
                <filename>${MLPREFIX}</filename> variable to ensure those names are extended
                correctly.
                This automatic extension code resides in <filename>multilib.bbclass</filename>.

            <title>Using Multilib</title>

            <para>
                After you have set up the recipes, you need to define the actual
                combination of multiple libraries you want to build.
                You accomplish this through your <filename>local.conf</filename>
                configuration file in the
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>.
                An example configuration would be as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     MACHINE = "qemux86-64"
     require conf/multilib.conf
     MULTILIBS = "multilib:lib32"
     DEFAULTTUNE_virtclass-multilib-lib32 = "x86"
     IMAGE_INSTALL = "lib32-connman"
                </literallayout>
                This example enables an
                additional library named <filename>lib32</filename> alongside the
                normal target packages.
                When combining these "lib32" alternatives, the example uses "x86" for tuning.
                For information on this particular tuning, see
                <filename>meta/conf/machine/include/ia32/arch-ia32.inc</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The example then includes <filename>lib32-connman</filename>
                in all the images, which illustrates one method of including a
                multiple library dependency.
                You can use a normal image build to include this dependency,
                for example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake core-image-sato
                </literallayout>
                You can also build Multilib packages specifically with a command like this:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $  bitbake lib32-connman
                </literallayout>

                to set kernel configurations.
                For general information on <filename>menuconfig</filename>, see
                <ulink url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menuconfig'></ulink>.

            <para>
                To use the <filename>menuconfig</filename> tool in the Yocto Project development
                environment, you must build the tool using BitBake.
                Thus, the environment must be set up using the <filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename>
                script found in the
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>.
                The following commands build and invoke <filename>menuconfig</filename> assuming the
                Source Directory top-level folder is <filename>~/poky</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky
     $ source oe-init-build-env
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c menuconfig
                </literallayout>
                Once <filename>menuconfig</filename> comes up, its standard interface allows you to
                interactively examine and configure all the kernel configuration parameters.
                After making your changes, simply exit the tool and save your changes to
                create an updated version of the <filename>.config</filename> configuration file.
            </para>

            <para>
                Consider an example that configures the <filename>linux-yocto-3.4</filename>
                kernel.
                The OpenEmbedded build system recognizes this kernel as
                <filename>linux-yocto</filename>.
                Thus, the following commands from the shell in which you previously sourced the
                environment initialization script cleans the shared state cache and the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>
                directory and then builds and launches <filename>menuconfig</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c menuconfig
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Once <filename>menuconfig</filename> launches, you use the interface
                to navigate through the selections to find the configuration settings in
                which you are interested.
                For example, consider the <filename>CONFIG_SMP</filename> configuration setting.
                You can find it at <filename>Processor Type and Features</filename> under
                the configuration selection <filename>Symmetric Multi-processing Support</filename>.
                After highlighting the selection, you can use the arrow keys to select or deselect
                the setting.
                When you are finished with all your selections, exit out and save them.
            </para>

            <para>
                Saving the selections updates the <filename>.config</filename> configuration file.
                This is the file that the OpenEmbedded build system uses to configure the
                kernel during the build.
                You can find and examine this file in the Build Directory in
                <filename>tmp/work/</filename>.
                The actual <filename>.config</filename> is located in the area where the
                specific kernel is built.
                For example, if you were building a Linux Yocto kernel based on the
                Linux 3.4 kernel and you were building a QEMU image targeted for
                <filename>x86</filename> architecture, the
                <filename>.config</filename> file would be located here:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ~/poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/linux-yocto-3.4.11+git1+84f...
        ...656ed30-r1/linux-qemux86-standard-build
                </literallayout>
                <note>
                    The previous example directory is artificially split and many of the characters
                    in the actual filename are omitted in order to make it more readable.
                    Also, depending on the kernel you are using, the exact pathname
                    for <filename>linux-yocto-3.4...</filename> might differ.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Within the <filename>.config</filename> file, you can see the kernel settings.
                For example, the following entry shows that symmetric multi-processor support
                is not set:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # CONFIG_SMP is not set
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                A good method to isolate changed configurations is to use a combination of the
                <filename>menuconfig</filename> tool and simple shell commands.
                Before changing configurations with <filename>menuconfig</filename>, copy the
                existing <filename>.config</filename> and rename it to something else,
                use <filename>menuconfig</filename> to make
                as many changes an you want and save them, then compare the renamed configuration
                file against the newly created file.
                You can use the resulting differences as your base to create configuration fragments
                to permanently save in your kernel layer.
                <note>
                    Be sure to make a copy of the <filename>.config</filename> and don't just
                    rename it.
                    The build system needs an existing <filename>.config</filename>
                    from which to work.

            <title>Creating Configuration Fragments</title>

            <para>
                Configuration fragments are simply kernel options that appear in a file
                placed where the OpenEmbedded build system can find and apply them.
                Syntactically, the configuration statement is identical to what would appear
                in the <filename>.config</filename> file, which is in the
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link> in
                <filename>tmp/work/&lt;arch&gt;-poky-linux/linux-yocto-&lt;release-specific-string&gt;/linux-&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;build-type&gt;</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is simple to create a configuration fragment.
                For example, issuing the following from the shell creates a configuration fragment
                file named <filename>my_smp.cfg</filename> that enables multi-processor support
                within the kernel:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ echo "CONFIG_SMP=y" >> my_smp.cfg
                </literallayout>
                <note>
                    All configuration files must use the <filename>.cfg</filename> extension in order
                    for the OpenEmbedded build system to recognize them as a configuration fragment.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Where do you put your configuration files?
                You can place these configuration files in the same area pointed to by
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename>.
                The OpenEmbedded build system will pick up the configuration and add it to the
                kernel's configuration.
                For example, suppose you had a set of configuration options in a file called
                <filename>myconfig.cfg</filename>.
                If you put that file inside a directory named <filename>/linux-yocto</filename>
                that resides in the same directory as the kernel's append file and then add
                a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement such as the following to the kernel's append file,
                those configuration options will be picked up and applied when the kernel is built.
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI += "file://myconfig.cfg"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                As mentioned earlier, you can group related configurations into multiple files and
                name them all in the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement as well.
                For example, you could group separate configurations specifically for Ethernet and graphics
                into their own files and add those by using a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement like the
                following in your append file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI += "file://myconfig.cfg \
            file://eth.cfg \
            file://gfx.cfg"

            <title>Incrementing a Package Revision Number</title>

            <para>
                If a committed change results in changing the package output,
                then the value of the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'>PR</ulink></filename>
                variable needs to be increased
                (or "bumped") as part of that commit.
                For new recipes you should add the <filename>PR</filename>
                variable and set its initial value equal to "r0", which is the default.
                Even though the default value is "r0", the practice of adding it to a new recipe makes
                it harder to forget to bump the variable when you make changes
                to the recipe in future.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you are sharing a common <filename>.inc</filename> file with multiple recipes,
                you can also use the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-INC_PR'>INC_PR</ulink></filename>
                variable to ensure that
                the recipes sharing the <filename>.inc</filename> file are rebuilt when the
                <filename>.inc</filename> file itself is changed.
                The <filename>.inc</filename> file must set <filename>INC_PR</filename>
                (initially to "r0"), and all recipes referring to it should set <filename>PR</filename>
                to "$(INC_PR).0" initially, incrementing the last number when the recipe is changed.
                If the <filename>.inc</filename> file is changed then its
                <filename>INC_PR</filename> should be incremented.

                When upgrading the version of a package, assuming the

                changes, the <filename>PR</filename> variable should be reset to "r0"
                (or "$(INC_PR).0" if you are using <filename>INC_PR</filename>).

            <para>
                Usually, version increases occur only to packages.
                However, if for some reason <filename>PV</filename> changes but does not
                increase, you can increase the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PE'>PE</ulink></filename>
                variable (Package Epoch).
                The <filename>PE</filename> variable defaults to "0".

                Version numbering strives to follow the

                Debian Version Field Policy Guidelines</ulink>.
                These guidelines define how versions are compared and what "increasing" a version means.
            </para>

            <para>
                There are two reasons for following the previously mentioned guidelines.
                First, to ensure that when a developer updates and rebuilds, they get all the changes to
                the repository and do not have to remember to rebuild any sections.
                Second, to ensure that target users are able to upgrade their
                devices using package manager commands such as <filename>opkg upgrade</filename>
                (or similar commands for dpkg/apt or rpm-based systems).
            </para>

            <para>
                The goal is to ensure the Yocto Project has packages that can be upgraded in all cases.

            <title>Handling a Package Name Alias</title>
            <para>
                Sometimes a package name you are using might exist under an alias or as a similarly named
                package in a different distribution.
                The OpenEmbedded build system implements a <filename>distro_check</filename>
                task that automatically connects to major distributions
                and checks for these situations.
                If the package exists under a different name in a different distribution, you get a
                <filename>distro_check</filename> mismatch.
                You can resolve this problem by defining a per-distro recipe name alias using the
                <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DISTRO_PN_ALIAS'>DISTRO_PN_ALIAS</ulink></filename>
                variable.
            </para>

            <para>
                Following is an example that shows how you specify the <filename>DISTRO_PN_ALIAS</filename>
                variable:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     DISTRO_PN_ALIAS_pn-PACKAGENAME = "distro1=package_name_alias1 \
                                       distro2=package_name_alias2 \
                                       distro3=package_name_alias3 \
                                       ..."
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                If you have more than one distribution alias, separate them with a space.
                Note that the build system currently automatically checks the
                Fedora, OpenSuSE, Debian, Ubuntu,
                and Mandriva distributions for source package recipes without having to specify them
                using the <filename>DISTRO_PN_ALIAS</filename> variable.
                For example, the following command generates a report that lists the Linux distributions
                that include the sources for each of the recipes.
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake world -f -c distro_check
                </literallayout>
                The results are stored in the <filename>build/tmp/log/distro_check-${DATETIME}.results</filename>
                file found in the Source Directory.

            <title>Handling Optional Module Packaging</title>

            <para>
                Many pieces of software split functionality into optional
                modules (or plugins) and the plugins that are built
                might depend on configuration options.
                To avoid having to duplicate the logic that determines what
                modules are available in your recipe or to avoid having
                to package each module by hand, the OpenEmbedded build system
                provides functionality to handle module packaging dynamically.
            </para>

            <para>
                To handle optional modual packaging, you need to do two things:

                <para>
                    To ensure the module packaging actually gets done, you use
                    the <filename>do_split_packages</filename> function within
                    the <filename>populate_packages</filename> python function
                    in your recipe.
                    The <filename>do_split_packages</filename> function
                    searches for a pattern of files or directories under a
                    specified path and creates a package for each one it finds
                    by appending to the <filename>PACKAGES</filename> variable
                    and setting the appropriate values for
                    <filename>FILES_packagename</filename>,
                    <filename>RDEPENDS_packagename</filename>,
                    <filename>DESCRIPTION_packagename</filename>, and so forth.
                    Here is an example from the <filename>lighttpd</filename>
                    recipe:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     python populate_packages_prepend () {
         lighttpd_libdir = d.expand('${libdir}')
         do_split_packages(d, lighttpd_libdir, '^mod_(.*)\.so$',
                          'lighttpd-module-%s', 'Lighttpd module for %s',
                           extra_depends='')
     }
                    </literallayout>
                    The previous example specifies a number of things in the

                    Often, packaging modules is as simple as the previous
                    example.
                    However, more advanced options exist that you can employ
                    to <filename>do_split_packages</filename> to modify its
                    behavior.
                    And, if you need to, you can add more logic by specifying
                    a hook function that is called for each package.
                    It is also perfectly acceptable to call
                    <filename>do_split_packages</filename> multiple times if
                    you have more than one set of modules to package.

     root
        The path in which to search
     file_regex
        Regular expression to match searched files.
        Use parentheses () to mark the part of this
        expression that should be used to derive the
        module name (to be substituted where %s is
        used in other function arguments as noted below)
     output_pattern
        Pattern to use for the package names. Must
        include %s.
     description
        Description to set for each package. Must
        include %s.

     Optional arguments

     postinst
        Postinstall script to use for all packages
        (as a string)
     recursive
        True to perform a recursive search - default
        False
     hook
        A hook function to be called for every match.
        The function will be called with the following
        arguments (in the order listed):

        f
           Full path to the file/directory match

           The module name derived using file_regex

     extra_depends
        Extra runtime dependencies (RDEPENDS) to be
        set for all packages. The default value of None
        causes a dependency on the main package
        (${PN}) - if you do not want this, pass empty
        string '' for this parameter.
     aux_files_pattern
        Extra item(s) to be added to FILES for each
        package. Can be a single string item or a list
        of strings for multiple items. Must include %s.
     postrm
        postrm script to use for all packages (as a
        string)
     allow_dirs
        True to allow directories to be matched -
        default False
     prepend
        If True, prepend created packages to PACKAGES
        instead of the default False which appends them
     match_path
        match file_regex on the whole relative path to
        the root rather than just the file name
     aux_files_pattern_verbatim
        Extra item(s) to be added to FILES for each
        package, using the actual derived module name
        rather than converting it to something legal
        for a package name. Can be a single string item
        or a list of strings for multiple items. Must
        include %s.

                <para>
                    The second part for handling optional module packaging
                    is to ensure that any dependencies on optional modules
                    from other recipes are satisfied by your recipe.
                    You can be sure these dependencies are satisfied by
                    using the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGES_DYNAMIC'><filename>PACKAGES_DYNAMIC</filename></ulink> variable.
                    Here is an example that continues with the
                    <filename>lighttpd</filename> recipe shown earlier:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGES_DYNAMIC = "lighttpd-module-.*"
                    </literallayout>
                    The name specified in the regular expression can of
                    course be anything.
                    In this example, it is <filename>lighttpd-module-</filename>
                    and is specified as the prefix to ensure that any
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>
                    and <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RRECOMMENDS'><filename>RRECOMMENDS</filename></ulink>
                    on a package name starting with the prefix are satisfied
                    during build time.
                    If you are using <filename>do_split_packages</filename>
                    as described in the previous section, the value you put in
                    <filename>PACKAGES_DYNAMIC</filename> should correspond to
                    the name pattern specified in the call to
                    <filename>do_split_packages</filename>.

        <title>Building Software from an External Source</title>

        <para>
            By default, the OpenEmbedded build system does its work from within the
            <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>.
            The build process involves fetching the source files, unpacking them, and then patching them
            if necessary before the build takes place.
        </para>

        <para>
            Situations exist where you might want to build software from source files that are external to
            and thus outside of the <link linkend='source-directory'>Source Directory</link>.
            For example, suppose you have a project that includes a new BSP with a heavily customized
            kernel, a very minimal image, and some new user-space recipes.
            And, you want to minimize exposing the build system to the
            development team so that they can focus on their project and maintain everyone's workflow
            as much as possible.
            In this case, you want a kernel source directory on the development machine where the
            development occurs.
            You want the recipe's
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
            variable to point to the external directory and use it as is, not copy it.
        </para>

        <para>
            To build from software that comes from an external source, all you need to do is
            change your recipe so that it inherits the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-externalsrc'><filename>externalsrc.bbclass</filename></ulink>
            class and then sets the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'><filename>S</filename></ulink>
            variable to point to your external source code.
            Here are the statements to put in your recipe:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     inherit externalsrc
     S = "/some/path/to/your/package/source"
            </literallayout>
        </para>

        <para>
            It is important to know that the <filename>externalsrc.bbclass</filename> assumes that the
            source directory <filename>S</filename> and the Build Directory
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-B'><filename>B</filename></ulink>
            are different even though by default these directories are the same.
            This assumption is important because it supports building different variants of the recipe
            by using the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBCLASSEXTEND'><filename>BBCLASSEXTEND</filename></ulink>
            variable.
            You could allow the Build Directory to be the same as the source directory but you would
            not be able to build more than one variant of the recipe.
            Consequently, if you are building multiple variants of the recipe, you need to establish a
            Build Directory that is different than the source directory.

        <title>Excluding Recipes From the Build</title>

        <para>
            You might find that there are groups of recipes you want to filter
            out of the build process.
            For example, recipes you know you will never use or want should not
            be part of the build.
            Removing these recipes from parsing speeds up parts of the build.
        </para>

        <para>
            It is possible to filter or mask out <filename>.bb</filename> and
            <filename>.bbappend</filename> files.
            You can do this by providing an expression with the
            <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBMASK'>BBMASK</ulink></filename>
            variable.
            Here is an example:

     BBMASK = ".*/meta-mymachine/recipes-maybe/"
            </literallayout>
            Here, all <filename>.bb</filename> and <filename>.bbappend</filename> files

        <para>
            If you're working on a recipe that pulls from an external Source Code Manager (SCM), it
            is possible to have the OpenEmbedded build system notice new recipe changes added to the
            SCM and then build the resulting package that depends on the new recipes by using the latest
            versions.
            This only works for SCMs from which it is possible to get a sensible revision number for changes.
            Currently, you can do this with Apache Subversion (SVN), Git, and Bazaar (BZR) repositories.

        <title>Debugging With the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) Remotely</title>

        <para>
            GDB allows you to examine running programs, which in turn helps you to understand and fix problems.
            It also allows you to perform post-mortem style analysis of program crashes.
            GDB is available as a package within the Yocto Project and by default is
            installed in SDK images.
            See the "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-images'>Images</ulink>" chapter
            in the Yocto Project Reference Manual for a description of these images.
            You can find information on GDB at <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/gdb/"/>.
        </para>

        <tip>
            For best results, install <filename>-dbg</filename> packages for the applications
            you are going to debug.
            Doing so makes available extra debug symbols that give you more meaningful output.
        </tip>

        <para>
            Sometimes, due to memory or disk space constraints, it is not possible
            to use GDB directly on the remote target to debug applications.
            These constraints arise because GDB needs to load the debugging information and the
            binaries of the process being debugged.
            Additionally, GDB needs to perform many computations to locate information such as function
            names, variable names and values, stack traces and so forth - even before starting the
            debugging process.
            These extra computations place more load on the target system and can alter the
            characteristics of the program being debugged.
        </para>

        <para>
            To help get past the previously mentioned constraints, you can use Gdbserver.
            Gdbserver runs on the remote target and does not load any debugging information
            from the debugged process.
            Instead, a GDB instance processes the debugging information that is run on a
            remote computer - the host GDB.
            The host GDB then sends control commands to Gdbserver to make it stop or start the debugged
            program, as well as read or write memory regions of that debugged program.
            All the debugging information loaded and processed as well
            as all the heavy debugging is done by the host GDB.
            Offloading these processes gives the Gdbserver running on the target a chance to remain
            small and fast.
        </para>

        <para>
            Because the host GDB is responsible for loading the debugging information and
            for doing the necessary processing to make actual debugging happen, the
            user has to make sure the host can access the unstripped binaries complete
            with their debugging information and also be sure the target is compiled with no optimizations.
            The host GDB must also have local access to all the libraries used by the
            debugged program.
            Because Gdbserver does not need any local debugging information, the binaries on
            the remote target can remain stripped.
            However, the binaries must also be compiled without optimization
            so they match the host's binaries.
        </para>

        <para>
            To remain consistent with GDB documentation and terminology, the binary being debugged
            on the remote target machine is referred to as the "inferior" binary.
            For documentation on GDB see the

                First, make sure Gdbserver is installed on the target.
                If it is not, install the package <filename>gdbserver</filename>, which needs the

                As an example, to launch Gdbserver on the target and make it ready to "debug" a

                to the target and launch:

                commands coming from a remote GDB process that is running on the host computer.
                Communication between Gdbserver and the host GDB are done using TCP.

                    also knows about the the ABI of the remote target.
                    You can get this binary from the meta-toolchain.

                    Perhaps the easiest way is to have an SDK image that corresponds to the plain

                    <filename>core-image-sato-sdk</filename> would contain suitable symbols.
                    Because the SDK images already have the debugging symbols installed, it is just a
                    question of expanding the archive to some location and then informing GDB.

                    Alternatively, the OpenEmbedded build system can build a custom directory of files
                    for a specific

                    For example, the following command form continues with the example used in

                    This command form loads the <filename>foo</filename> binary

                    Once the GDB prompt appears, you must instruct GDB to load all the libraries
                    of the inferior binary from <filename>tmp/rootfs</filename> as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>

                    At this point you can have GDB connect to the Gdbserver that is running

            statistical profiler well suited for finding performance

            This profiler provides answers to questions like "Which functions does my application spend
            the most time in when doing X?"
            Because the OpenEmbedded build system is well integrated with OProfile, it makes profiling

        <para>
            To use OProfile, you need an image that has OProfile installed.

            <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_FEATURES'>IMAGE_FEATURES</ulink></filename> variable.
            You also need debugging symbols to be available on the system where the analysis
            takes place.
            You can gain access to the symbols by using <filename>dbg-pkgs</filename> in the
            <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> variable or by
            installing the appropriate <filename>-dbg</filename> packages.

        <para>
            For successful call graph analysis, the binaries must preserve the frame
            pointer register and should also be compiled with the
            <filename>-fno-omit-framepointer</filename> flag.
            You can achieve this by setting the
            <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SELECTED_OPTIMIZATION'>SELECTED_OPTIMIZATION</ulink></filename>

            variable to "1" in the <filename>local.conf</filename> configuration file.
            If you use the <filename>DEBUG_BUILD</filename> variable,

                In this example, the <filename>reset</filename> command clears any previously profiled data.
                The next command starts OProfile.
                The options used when starting the profiler separate dynamic library data

                <note>
                    To profile the kernel, you would specify the
                    <filename>--vmlinux=/path/to/vmlinux</filename> option.
                    The <filename>vmlinux</filename> file is usually in the source directory in the
                    <filename>/boot/</filename> directory and must match the running kernel.

                After you perform your profiling tasks, the next command stops the profiler.
                After that, you can view results with the <filename>opreport</filename> command with options
                to see the separate library symbols and callgraph information.
            </para>

            <para>
                Callgraphing logs information about time spent in functions and about a function's
                calling function (parent) and called functions (children).
                The higher the callgraphing depth, the more accurate the results.
                However, higher depths also increase the logging overhead.
                Consequently, you should take care when setting the callgraphing depth.
                <note>
                    On ARM, binaries need to have the frame pointer enabled for callgraphing to work.
                    To accomplish this use the <filename>-fno-omit-framepointer</filename> option
                    with <filename>gcc</filename>.

                Even though the source directory usually includes all needed patches on the target device, you

                <para>
                    Using OProfile in online mode assumes a working network connection with the target
                    hardware.
                    With this connection, you just need to run "oprofile-server" on the device.
                    By default, OProfile listens on port 4224.
                    <note>
                        You can change the port using the <filename>--port</filename> command-line

                    The client downloads the complete 'profile archive' from
                    the target to the host for processing.
                    This archive is a directory that contains the sample data, the object files,
                    and the debug information for the object files.
                    The archive is then converted using the <filename>oparchconv</filename> script, which is
                    included in this distribution.
                    The script uses <filename>opimport</filename> to convert the archive from
                    the target to something that can be processed on the host.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Downloaded archives reside in the Build Directory in
                    <filename>/tmp</filename> and are cleared up when they are no longer in use.

                <para>
                    If you wish to perform kernel profiling, you need to be sure
                    a <filename>vmlinux</filename> file that matches the running kernel is available.
                    In the source directory, that file is usually located in
                    <filename>/boot/vmlinux-KERNELVERSION</filename>, where
                    <filename>KERNEL-version</filename> is the version of the kernel.
                    The OpenEmbedded build system generates separate <filename>vmlinux</filename>
                    packages for each kernel it builds.
                    Thus, it should just be a question of making sure a matching package is
                    installed (e.g. <filename>opkg install kernel-vmlinux</filename>.
                    The files are automatically installed into development and profiling images
                    alongside OProfile.
                    A configuration option exists within the OProfileUI settings page that you can use to
                    enter the location of the <filename>vmlinux</filename> file.

                    Waiting for debug symbols to transfer from the device can be slow, and it
                    is not always necessary to actually have them on the device for OProfile use.
                    All that is needed is a copy of the filesystem with the debug symbols present
                    on the viewer system.

                    section covers how to create such a directory with
                    the source directory and how to use the OProfileUI Settings dialog to specify the location.
                    If you specify the directory, it will be used when the file checksums
                    match those on the system you are profiling.

                    If network access to the target is unavailable, you can generate
                    an archive for processing in <filename>oprofile-viewer</filename> as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # opcontrol --reset
     # opcontrol --start --separate=lib --no-vmlinux -c 5

     [do whatever is being profiled]
            .
            .
     # opcontrol --stop
     # oparchive -o my_archive
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    In the above example, <filename>my_archive</filename> is the name of the
                    archive directory where you would like the profile archive to be kept.
                    After the directory is created, you can copy it to another host and load it
                    using <filename>oprofile-viewer</filename> open functionality.
                    If necessary, the archive is converted.

        <title>Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle</title>

        <para>
            One of the concerns for a development organization using open source
            software is how to maintain compliance with various open source
            licensing during the lifecycle of the product.
            While this section does not provide legal advice or
            comprehensively cover all scenarios, it does
            present methods that you can use to
            assist you in meeting the compliance requirements during a software
            release.
        </para>

        <para>
            With hundreds of different open source licenses that the Yocto
            Project tracks, it is difficult to know the requirements of each
            and every license.
            However, we can begin to cover the requirements of the major FLOSS licenses, by
            assuming that there are three main areas of concern:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Source code must be provided.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>License text for the software must be
                    provided.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Compilation scripts and modifications to the
                    source code must be provided.
                    </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            There are other requirements beyond the scope of these
            three and the methods described in this section
            (e.g. the mechanism through which source code is distributed).
            As different organizations have different methods of complying with
            open source licensing, this section is not meant to imply that
            there is only one single way to meet your compliance obligations,
            but rather to describe one method of achieving compliance.
        </para>

        <para>
            The remainder of this section describes methods supported to meet the
            previously mentioned three requirements.
            Once you take steps to meet these requirements,
            and prior to releasing images, sources, and the build system,
            you should audit all artifacts to ensure completeness.
            The Yocto Project generates a license manifest during
            image creation that is located
            in <filename>${DEPLOY_DIR}/licenses/&lt;image_name-datestamp&gt;</filename>
            to assist with any audits.
        </para>

        <section id='providing-the-source-code'>
            <title>Providing the Source Code</title>

            <para>
                Compliance activities should begin before you generate the
                final image.
                The first thing you should look at is the requirement that
                tops the list for most compliance groups - providing
                the source.
                The Yocto Project has a few ways of meeting this
                requirement.
            </para>

            <para>
                One of the easiest ways to meet this requirement is
                to provide the entire
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>
                used by the build.
                This method, however, has a few issues.
                The most obvious is the size of the directory since it includes
                all sources used in the build and not just the source used in
                the released image.
                It will include toolchain source, and other artifacts which
                you would not generally release.
                But, the more serious issue for most companies is accidental
                release of proprietary software.
                The Yocto Project provides an archiver class to help avoid
                some of these concerns.
            </para>

            <para>
                Before you employ <filename>DL_DIR</filename> or the
                archiver class, you need to decide how you choose to
                provide source.
                The source archiver class can generate tarballs and SRPMs
                and can create them with various levels of compliance in mind.
                One way of doing this (but certainly not the only way) is to
                release just the original source as a tarball.
                You can do this by adding the following to the
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file found in the
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ARCHIVER_MODE ?= "original"
     ARCHIVER_CLASS = "${@'archive-${ARCHIVER_MODE}-source' if
     ARCHIVER_MODE != 'none' else ''}"
     INHERIT += "${ARCHIVER_CLASS}"
     SOURCE_ARCHIVE_PACKAGE_TYPE = "tar"
                </literallayout>
                During the creation of your image, all GPL
                or other copyleft licensed source
                is placed within subdirectories of
                <filename>DEPLOY_DIR/sources</filename> based on the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE'><filename>LICENSE</filename></ulink>
                for each recipe.
                Releasing the entire directory enables you to comply with
                requirements concerning providing the unmodified source.
                It is important to note that the size of the directory can
                get large.
            </para>

            <para>
                A way to help mitigate the size issue is to only release
                tarballs for licenses that require the release of
                source.
                Let's assume you are only concerned with GPL code as
                identified with the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd poky/build/tmp/deploy/sources
     $ mkdir ~/gpl_source_release
     $ for dir in */*GPL*; do cp -r $dir ~/gpl_source_release; done
                </literallayout>
                At this point, you could create a tarball from the
                <filename>gpl_source_release</filename> directory and
                provide that to the end user.
                This method would be a step toward achieving compliance
                with section 3a of GPLv2 and with section 6 of GPLv3.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='providing-license-text'>
            <title>Providing License Text</title>

            <para>
                One requirement that is often overlooked is inclusion
                of license text.
                This requirement also needs to be dealt with prior to
                generating the final image.
                Some licenses require the license text to accompany
                the binary.
                You can achieve this by adding the following to your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     COPY_LIC_MANIFEST = "1"
     COPY_LIC_DIRS = "1"
                </literallayout>
                Adding these statements to the configuration file ensures
                that the licenses collected during package generation
                are included on your image.
                As the source archiver has already archived the original
                unmodified source which would contain the license files,
                you would have already met the requirements for inclusion
                of the license information with source as defined by the GPL
                and other open source licenses.
            </para>

        <section id='providing-compilation-scripts-and-source-code-modifications'>
            <title>Providing Compilation Scripts and Source Code Modifications</title>

            <para>
                At this point, we have addressed all we need to address
                prior to generating the image.
                The next two requirements are addressed during the final
                packaging of the release.
            </para>

            <para>
                By releasing the version of the OpenEmbedded build system
                and the layers used during the build, you will be providing both
                compilation scripts and the source code modifications in one
                step.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the deployment team has a
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-layers'>BSP layer</ulink>
                and a distro layer, and those those layers are used to patch,
                compile, package, or modify (in any way) any open source
                software included in your released images, you
                may be required to to release those layers under section 3 of
                GPLv2 or section 1 of GPLv3.
                One way of doing that is with a clean
                checkout of the version of the Yocto Project and layers used
                during your build.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # We built using the &DISTRO_NAME; branch of the poky repo
     $ git clone -b &DISTRO_NAME; git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
     $ cd poky
     # We built using the release_branch for our layers
     $ git clone -b release_branch git://git.mycompany.com/meta-my-bsp-layer
     $ git clone -b release_branch git://git.mycompany.com/meta-my-software-layer
     # clean up the .git repos
     $ find . -name ".git" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
                </literallayout>
                One thing a development organization might want to consider
                for end-user convenience is to modify

                ensure that when the end user utilizes the released build

                requirements to include the scripts to control compilation
                as well as any modifications to the original source.
