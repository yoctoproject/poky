<title>Common Development Models</title>

<para>
    Many development models exist for which you can use the Yocto Project.
    This chapter overviews simple methods that use tools provided by the
    Yocto Project:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>System Development:</emphasis>
             System Development covers Board Support Package (BSP) development
             and kernel modification or configuration.
             For an example on how to create a BSP, see the

             section in the Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP)
             Developer's Guide.
             For more complete information on how to work with the kernel,
             see the

         <listitem><para><emphasis>User Application Development:</emphasis>
             User Application Development covers development of applications
             that you intend to run on target hardware.

         <listitem><para><emphasis>Temporary Source Code Modification:</emphasis>
             Direct modification of temporary source code is a convenient
             development model to quickly iterate and develop towards a
             solution.
             Once you implement the solution, you should of course take
             steps to get the changes upstream and applied in the affected
             recipes.

             You can use <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;/Tools-resources/projects/toaster'>Toaster</ulink>
             to build custom operating system images within the build
             environment.
             Toaster provides an efficient interface to the OpenEmbedded build
             that allows you to start builds and examine build statistics.

<section id='system-development-model'>
    <title>System Development Workflow</title>

    <para>
        System development involves modification or creation of an image that you want to run on
        a specific hardware target.
        Usually, when you want to create an image that runs on embedded hardware, the image does
        not require the same number of features that a full-fledged Linux distribution provides.
        Thus, you can create a much smaller image that is designed to use only the
        features for your particular hardware.
    </para>

    <para>
        To help you understand how system development works in the Yocto Project, this section
        covers two types of image development:  BSP creation and kernel modification or
        configuration.
    </para>

    <section id='developing-a-board-support-package-bsp'>
        <title>Developing a Board Support Package (BSP)</title>

        <para>
            A BSP is a collection of recipes that, when applied during a build, results in
            an image that you can run on a particular board.
            Thus, the package when compiled into the new image, supports the operation of the board.
        </para>

        </note>

        <para>
            The remainder of this section presents the basic
            steps used to create a BSP using the Yocto Project's
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#using-the-yocto-projects-bsp-tools'>BSP Tools</ulink>.
            Although not required for BSP creation, the
            <filename>meta-intel</filename> repository, which contains
            many BSPs supported by the Yocto Project, is part of the example.
        </para>

                    Layers are ideal for
                    isolating and storing work for a given piece of hardware.
                    A layer is really just a location or area in which you place
                    the recipes and configurations for your BSP.
                    In fact, a BSP is, in itself, a special type of layer.
                    The simplest way to create a new BSP layer that is compliant with the
                    Yocto Project is to use the <filename>yocto-bsp</filename> script.
                    For information about that script, see the
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#creating-a-new-bsp-layer-using-the-yocto-bsp-script'>Creating a New BSP Layer Using the yocto-bsp Script</ulink>"
                    section in the Yocto Project Board Support (BSP) Developer's Guide.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                    Another example that illustrates a layer is an application.
                    Suppose you are creating an application that has library or other dependencies in
                    order for it to compile and run.
                    The layer, in this case, would be where all the recipes that define those dependencies
                    are kept.
                    The key point for a layer is that it is an isolated area that contains
                    all the relevant information for the project that the OpenEmbedded build
                    system knows about.
                    For more information on layers, see the
                    "<link linkend='understanding-and-creating-layers'>Understanding and Creating Layers</link>"
                    section.
                    For more information on BSP layers, see the
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-layers'>BSP Layers</ulink>" section in the
                    Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide.</para>
                    <note>Five BSPs exist that are part of the
                    Yocto Project release: <filename>genericx86</filename>, <filename>genericx86-64</filename>,
                    <filename>beaglebone</filename> (ARM),
                    <filename>mpc8315e</filename> (PowerPC),
                    and <filename>edgerouter</filename> (MIPS).
                    The recipes and configurations for these five BSPs are located and dispersed
                    within the <link linkend='source-directory'>Source Directory</link>.
                    On the other hand, the <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer
                    contains BSP layers for many supported BSPs (e.g.
                    Crystal Forest, Emenlow, Fish River Island 2, Haswell,
                    Jasper Forest, and so forth).
                    Aside from the BSPs in the <filename>meta-intel</filename>
                    layer, the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;'>Source Repositories</ulink>
                    contain additional BSP layers such as
                    <filename>meta-minnow</filename> and
                    <filename>meta-raspberrypi</filename>.</note>
                    <para>When you set up a layer for a new BSP, you should follow a standard layout.
                    This layout is described in the
                    "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#bsp-filelayout'>Example Filesystem Layout</ulink>"
                    section of the Board Support Package (BSP) Development Guide.
                    In the standard layout, you will notice a suggested structure for recipes and
                    configuration information.
                    You can see the standard layout for a BSP by examining
                    any supported BSP found in the <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer inside
                    the Source Directory.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Make configuration changes to your new BSP
                    layer</emphasis>:  The standard BSP layer structure organizes the files you need
                    to edit in <filename>conf</filename> and several <filename>recipes-*</filename>
                    directories within the BSP layer.
                    Configuration changes identify where your new layer is on the local system
                    and identify which kernel you are going to use.
                    When you run the <filename>yocto-bsp</filename> script, you are able to interactively
                    configure many things for the BSP (e.g. keyboard, touchscreen, and so forth).

                <listitem><para><emphasis>Make recipe changes to your new BSP layer</emphasis>:  Recipe
                    changes include altering recipes (<filename>.bb</filename> files), removing
                    recipes you do not use, and adding new recipes or append files
                    (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) that you need to support your hardware.
                    </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Prepare for the build</emphasis>:  Once you have made all the
                    changes to your BSP layer, there remains a few things
                    you need to do for the OpenEmbedded build system in order for it to create your image.
                    You need to get the build environment ready by sourcing an environment setup script
                    (i.e. <filename>oe-init-build-env</filename> or
                    <filename>oe-init-build-env-memres</filename>)
                    and you need to be sure two key configuration files are configured appropriately:
                    the <filename>conf/local.conf</filename> and the
                    <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file.
                    You must make the OpenEmbedded build system aware of your new layer.

        <para>
            Kernel modification involves changing the Yocto Project kernel, which could involve changing
            configuration options as well as adding new kernel recipes.
            Configuration changes can be added in the form of configuration fragments, while recipe
            modification comes through the kernel's <filename>recipes-kernel</filename> area
            in a kernel layer you create.

            The remainder of this section presents a high-level overview of the Yocto Project
            kernel architecture and the steps to modify the kernel.

            <title>Kernel Overview</title>

            <para>
                Traditionally, when one thinks of a patched kernel, they think of a base kernel
                source tree and a fixed structure that contains kernel patches.
                The Yocto Project, however, employs mechanisms that, in a sense, result in a kernel source
                generator.
                By the end of this section, this analogy will become clearer.

            <para>
                The kernels are maintained using the Git revision control system
                that structures them using the familiar "tree", "branch", and "leaf" scheme.
                Branches represent diversions from general code to more specific code, while leaves
                represent the end-points for a complete and unique kernel whose source files,
                when gathered from the root of the tree to the leaf, accumulate to create the files
                necessary for a specific piece of hardware and its features.
                The following figure displays this concept:
            <para>
                <imagedata fileref="figures/kernel-overview-1.png"
                    width="6in" depth="6in" align="center" scale="100" />
            </para>

            <para>
                Within the figure, the "Kernel.org Branch Point" represents the point in the tree
                where a supported base kernel is modified from the Linux kernel.
                For example, this could be the branch point for the <filename>linux-yocto-3.19</filename>
                kernel.
                Thus, everything further to the right in the structure is based on the
                <filename>linux-yocto-3.19</filename> kernel.
                Branch points to the right in the figure represent where the
                <filename>linux-yocto-3.19</filename> kernel is modified for specific hardware
                or types of kernels, such as real-time kernels.
                Each leaf thus represents the end-point for a kernel designed to run on a specific
                targeted device.
            </para>

            <para>
                The overall result is a Git-maintained repository from which all the supported
                kernel types can be derived for all the supported devices.
                A big advantage to this scheme is the sharing of common features by keeping them in
                "larger" branches within the tree.
                This practice eliminates redundant storage of similar features shared among kernels.
            </para>

            <note>
                Keep in mind the figure does not take into account all the supported Yocto
                Project kernel types, but rather shows a single generic kernel just for conceptual purposes.
                Also keep in mind that this structure represents the Yocto Project source repositories
                that are either pulled from during the build or established on the host development system
                prior to the build by either cloning a particular kernel's Git repository or by
                downloading and unpacking a tarball.
            </note>

            <para>
                Upstream storage of all the available kernel source code is one thing, while
                representing and using the code on your host development system is another.
                Conceptually, you can think of the kernel source repositories as all the
                source files necessary for all the supported kernels.
                As a developer, you are just interested in the source files for the kernel on
                which you are working.
                And, furthermore, you need them available on your host system.
            </para>

            <para>
                Kernel source code is available on your host system a couple of different
                ways.
                If you are working in the kernel all the time, you probably would want
                to set up your own local Git repository of the kernel tree.
                If you just need to make some patches to the kernel, you can access
                temporary kernel source files that were extracted and used
                during a build.
                We will just talk about working with the temporary source code.
                For more information on how to get kernel source code onto your
                host system, see the
                "<link linkend='local-kernel-files'>Yocto Project Kernel</link>"
                bulleted item earlier in the manual.
            </para>

            <para>
                What happens during the build?
                When you build the kernel on your development system, all files needed for the build
                are taken from the source repositories pointed to by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink> variable
                and gathered in a temporary work area
                where they are subsequently used to create the unique kernel.
                Thus, in a sense, the process constructs a local source tree specific to your
                kernel to generate the new kernel image - a source generator if you will.
            </para>
                The following figure shows the temporary file structure
                created on your host system when the build occurs.
                This
                <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link> contains all the
                source files used during the build.

    <title>Application Development Workflow</title>

    <para>
        Application development involves creating an application that you want
        to run on your target hardware, which is running a kernel image created using the
        OpenEmbedded build system.
        The Yocto Project provides an
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_ADT_URL;#adt-intro'>Application Development Toolkit (ADT)</ulink>
        and stand-alone
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_ADT_URL;#the-cross-development-toolchain'>cross-development toolchains</ulink>
        that facilitate quick development and integration of your application into its runtime environment.
        Using the ADT and toolchains, you can compile and link your application.
        You can then deploy your application to the actual hardware or to the QEMU emulator for testing.
        If you are familiar with the popular <trademark class='trade'>Eclipse</trademark> IDE,
        you can use an Eclipse Yocto Plug-in to
        allow you to develop, deploy, and test your application all from within Eclipse.
    </para>

    <para>
        While we strongly suggest using the ADT to develop your application, this option might not
        be best for you.
        If this is the case, you can still use pieces of the Yocto Project for your development process.
        However, because the process can vary greatly, this manual does not provide detail on the process.

            <note>
                This release of the Yocto Project supports both the Luna
                and Kepler versions of the Eclipse IDE.

            When you install and configure the Eclipse Yocto Project Plug-in
            into the Eclipse IDE, you maximize your Yocto Project experience.
            Installing and configuring the Plug-in results in an environment
            that has extensions specifically designed to let you more easily
            develop software.
            These extensions allow for cross-compilation, deployment, and
            execution of your output into a QEMU emulation session as well as
            actual target hardware.
            You can also perform cross-debugging and profiling.
            The environment also supports a suite of tools that allows you
            to perform remote profiling, tracing, collection of power data,
            collection of latency data, and collection of performance data.

                    installed and you do not want to upgrade the IDE, you can
                    configure Kepler to work with the Yocto Project.

                    You do have opportunities to change them later when

                    When building "Yocto Project ADT Autotools" projects, the Eclipse
                    IDE might display error messages for Functions/Symbols/Types
                    that cannot be "resolved", even when the related include file
                    is listed at the project navigator and when the project is
                    able to build.
                    For these cases only, it is recommended to add a new linked
                    folder to the appropriate sysroot.
                    Use these steps to add the linked folder:

                As mentioned earlier in the manual, several tools exist that
                enhance your development experience.
                These tools are aids in developing and debugging applications
                and images.
                You can run these user-space tools from within the Eclipse
                IDE through the "YoctoProjectTools" menu.
            </para>

            <para>
                Once you pick a tool, you need to configure it for the remote
                target.
                Every tool needs to have the connection configured.
                You must select an existing TCF-based RSE connection to the
                remote target.
                If one does not exist, click "New" to create one.

    <title>Modifying Source Code</title>

    <para>
        A common development workflow consists of modifying project source
        files that are external to the Yocto Project and then integrating
        that project's build output into an image built using the
        OpenEmbedded build system.
        Given this scenario, development engineers typically want to stick
        to their familiar project development tools and methods, which allows
        them to just focus on the project.
    </para>

    <para>
        Several workflows exist that allow you to develop, build, and test
        code that is going to be integrated into an image built using the
        OpenEmbedded build system.
        This section describes two:

            <title>Use <filename>devtool add</filename> to Integrate New Code</title>

            <para>
                The <filename>devtool add</filename> command generates
                a new recipe based on existing source code.
                This command takes advantage of the
                <link linkend='devtool-the-workspace-layer-structure'>workspace</link>
                layer that many <filename>devtool</filename> commands
                use.
                The command is flexible enough to allow you to extract source
                code into both the workspace or a separate local Git repository
                and to use existing code that does not need to be extracted.
            </para>

            <para>
                Depending on your particular scenario, the arguments and options
                you use with <filename>devtool add</filename> form different
                combinations.
                The following diagram shows common development flows
                you would use with the <filename>devtool add</filename>
                command:

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Generating the New Recipe</emphasis>:
                        The top part of the flow shows three scenarios by which
                        you could use <filename>devtool add</filename> to
                        generate a recipe based on existing source code.</para>

                        <para>In a shared development environment, it is
                        typical where other developers are responsible for
                        various areas of source code.
                        As a developer, you are probably interested in using
                        that source code as part of your development using
                        the Yocto Project.
                        All you need is access to the code, a recipe, and a
                        controlled area in which to do your work.</para>

                        <para>Within the diagram, three possible scenarios
                        feed into the <filename>devtool add</filename> workflow:
                        <itemizedlist>
                            <listitem><para><emphasis>Left</emphasis>:
                                The left scenario represents a common situation
                                where the source code does not exist locally
                                and needs to be extracted.
                                In this situation, you just let it get
                                extracted to the default workspace - you do not
                                want it in some specific location outside of the
                                workspace.
                                Thus, everything you need will be located in the
                                workspace:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool add <replaceable>recipe fetchuri</replaceable>
                                </literallayout>
                                With this command, <filename>devtool</filename>
                                creates a recipe and an append file in the
                                workspace as well as extracts the upstream
                                source files into a local Git repository also
                                within the <filename>sources</filename> folder.
                                </para></listitem>
                            <listitem><para><emphasis>Middle</emphasis>:
                                The middle scenario also represents a situation where
                                the source code does not exist locally.
                                In this case, the code is again upstream
                                and needs to be extracted to some
                                local area - this time outside of the default
                                workspace.
                                As always, if required <filename>devtool</filename> creates
                                a Git repository locally during the extraction.
                                Furthermore, the first positional argument
                                <replaceable>srctree</replaceable> in this case
                                identifies where the
                                <filename>devtool add</filename> command
                                will locate the extracted code outside of the
                                workspace:
                                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool add <replaceable>recipe srctree fetchuri</replaceable>
                                </literallayout>
                                In summary, the source code is pulled from
                                <replaceable>fetchuri</replaceable> and extracted
                                into the location defined by
                                <replaceable>srctree</replaceable> as a local

                        You can deploy your build output to that target hardware by

                The command is flexible enough to allow you to extract code,

                                In this situation, the source is extracted
                                into the default workspace location.
                                The recipe, in this scenario, is in its own
                                layer outside the workspace
                                (i.e.

                                variable to locate the source code and

                                located.

                                extracts the source files to a Git structure.

                                The result is that the command sets up both the source
                                code and an append file within the workspace with the

            <para>
                The <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command updates
                an existing recipe so that you can build it for an updated
                set of source files.
                The command is flexible enough to allow you to specify
                source code revision and versioning schemes, extract code into
                or out of the <filename>devtool</filename> workspace, and
                work with any source file forms that the fetchers support.

                The following diagram shows a common development flow

                                in the recipe (e.g. a tarball with the new version
                                number in the name, or as a different revision in
                                the upstream Git repository).

                        </itemizedlist>
                        A common situation is where third-party software has
                        undergone a revision so that it has been upgraded.
                        The recipe you have access to is likely in your own layer.
                        Thus, you need to upgrade the recipe to use the
                        newer version of the software:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool upgrade -V <replaceable>version recipe</replaceable>
                        </literallayout>
                        By default, the <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command
                        extracts source code into the <filename>sources</filename>
                        directory in the workspace.
                        If you want the code extracted to any other location, you
                        need to provide the <replaceable>srctree</replaceable>
                        positional argument with the command as follows:
                        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool upgrade -V <replaceable>version recipe srctree</replaceable>
                        </literallayout>
                        Also, in this example, the "-V" option is used to specify
                        the new version.
                        If the source files pointed to by the
                        <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement in the recipe are
                        in a Git repository, you must provide the "-S" option and
                        specify a revision for the software.</para>

                        <para>Once <filename>devtool</filename> locates the recipe,
                        it uses the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable to locate
                        the source code and any local patch files from other
                        developers are located.
                        The result is that the command sets up the source
                        code, the new version of the recipe, and an append file
                        all within the workspace.

     README - Provides information on what is in workspace layer and how to

                 Often, you might want to apply customizations made to your
                 software in your own layer rather than apply them to the
                 original recipe.
                 If so, you can use the
                 <filename>-a</filename> or <filename>--append</filename>
                 option with the <filename>devtool update-recipe</filename>
                 command.
                 These options allow you to specify the layer into which to
                 write an append file:
                 <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ devtool update-recipe <replaceable>recipe</replaceable> -a <replaceable>base-layer-directory</replaceable>
                 </literallayout>
                 The <filename>*.bbappend</filename> file is created at the
                 appropriate path within the specified layer directory, which
                 may or may not be in your <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>
                 file.
                 If an append file already exists, the command updates it
                 appropriately.

                to upgrade an existing recipe to a new upstream version.
                The command puts the upgraded recipe file into the
                workspace along with any associated files, and extracts
                the source tree to a specified location should patches
                need rebased or added to as a result of the upgrade.

            <para>
                When you use the <filename>devtool upgrade</filename> command,

                paths, or extensions), and you must supply the directory
                to which you want the source extracted.
                Additional command options let you control things such as
                the version number to which you want to upgrade (i.e. the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PV'><filename>PV</filename></ulink>),

                Realize that this command deletes the recipe and the

                The command does not physically move them for you.

                    To create a new patch file, use <filename>quilt new</filename> as below:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>

                    After creating the patch, you need to notify Quilt about the files
                    you plan to edit.
                    You notify Quilt by adding the files to the patch you just created:

                <listitem><para><emphasis>Test Your Changes:</emphasis>
                    Once you have modified the source code, the easiest way to

                    <filename>do_compile</filename> task as shown in the
                    following example:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -c compile -f <replaceable>package</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    The <filename>-f</filename> or <filename>--force</filename>
                    option forces the specified task to execute.
                    If you find problems with your code, you can just keep editing and
                    re-testing iteratively until things work as expected.
                    <note>All the modifications you make to the temporary source code
                    disappear once you run the

                    and
                    <filename>bitbake -c cleanall <replaceable>package</replaceable></filename>).
                    Modifications will also disappear if you use the <filename>rm_work</filename>

                    For simplicity, copy the patch file into a directory named <filename>files</filename>,
                    which you can create in the same directory that holds the recipe

                    append (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) file.
                    Placing the patch here guarantees that the OpenEmbedded build system will find
                    the patch.
                    Next, add the patch into the

                    of the recipe.

        <title>Finding Temporary Source Code</title>

        <para>
            You might find it helpful during development to modify the
            temporary source code used by recipes to build packages.
            For example, suppose you are developing a patch and you need to
            experiment a bit to figure out your solution.
            After you have initially built the package, you can iteratively
            tweak the source code, which is located in the
            <link linkend='build-directory'>Build Directory</link>, and then
            you can force a re-compile and quickly test your altered code.
            Once you settle on a solution, you can then preserve your changes
            in the form of patches.
            If you are using Quilt for development, see the
            "<link linkend='using-a-quilt-workflow'>Using Quilt in Your Workflow</link>"
            section for more information.
        </para>

        <para>
            During a build, the unpacked temporary source code used by recipes
            to build packages is available in the Build Directory as
            defined by the
            <filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'>S</ulink></filename> variable.
            Below is the default value for the <filename>S</filename> variable as defined in the
            <filename>meta/conf/bitbake.conf</filename> configuration file in the
            <link linkend='source-directory'>Source Directory</link>:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     S = "${WORKDIR}/${BP}"
            </literallayout>
            You should be aware that many recipes override the <filename>S</filename> variable.
            For example, recipes that fetch their source from Git usually set
            <filename>S</filename> to <filename>${WORKDIR}/git</filename>.
            <note>
                The

            The path to the work directory for the recipe
            (<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>)
            is defined as follows:

        <para>
            As an example, assume a Source Directory top-level folder
            named <filename>poky</filename>, a default Build Directory at
            <filename>poky/build</filename>, and a
            <filename>qemux86-poky-linux</filename> machine target
            system.
            Furthermore, suppose your recipe is named
            <filename>foo_1.3.0.bb</filename>.
            In this case, the work directory the build system uses to
            build the package would be as follows:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/foo/1.3.0-r0
            </literallayout>

        <para>
            Now that you know where to locate the directory that has the
            temporary source code, you can use a Quilt as described in section
            "<link linkend='using-a-quilt-workflow'>Using Quilt in Your Workflow</link>"
            to make your edits, test the changes, and preserve the changes in

    <title>Using a Development Shell</title>

    <para>
        When debugging certain commands or even when just editing packages,
        <filename>devshell</filename> can be a useful tool.
        When you invoke <filename>devshell</filename>, source files are
        extracted into your working directory and patches are applied.
        Then, a new terminal is opened and you are placed in the working directory.
        In the new terminal, all the OpenEmbedded build-related environment variables are
        still defined so you can use commands such as <filename>configure</filename> and
        <filename>make</filename>.
        The commands execute just as if the OpenEmbedded build system were executing them.
        Consequently, working this way can be helpful when debugging a build or preparing
        software to be used with the OpenEmbedded build system.
    </para>

    <para>
        Following is an example that uses <filename>devshell</filename> on a target named
        <filename>matchbox-desktop</filename>:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -c devshell
        </literallayout>
    </para>

    <para>
        This command spawns a terminal with a shell prompt within the OpenEmbedded build environment.
        The <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-OE_TERMINAL'><filename>OE_TERMINAL</filename></ulink>
        variable controls what type of shell is opened.
    </para>

    <para>
        For spawned terminals, the following occurs:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>The <filename>PATH</filename> variable includes the
                cross-toolchain.</para></listitem>

                <filename>.pc</filename> files.</para></listitem>

        </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
        Within this environment, you can run configure or compile
        commands as if they were being run by
        the OpenEmbedded build system itself.
        As noted earlier, the working directory also automatically changes to the
        Source Directory (<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-S'><filename>S</filename></ulink>).
    </para>

    <para>
        To manually run a specific task using <filename>devshell</filename>,
        run the corresponding <filename>run.*</filename> script in

        <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink><filename>}/temp</filename>
        (e.g., <filename>run.do_configure.</filename><replaceable>pid</replaceable>).
        If a task's script does not exist, which would be the case if the task was
        skipped by way of the sstate cache, you can create the task by first running
        it outside of the <filename>devshell</filename>:

                    script and BitBake's execution of a task are identical.
                    In other words, running the script re-runs the task
                    just as it would be run using the
                    <filename>bitbake -c</filename> command.

        Remember, that the <filename>devshell</filename> is a mechanism that allows
