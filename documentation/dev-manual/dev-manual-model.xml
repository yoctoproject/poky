<title>Common Development Models</title>

<para>
    Many development models exist for which you can use the Yocto Project. 
    However, for the purposes of this manual we are going to focus on two common ones:  
    System Development and User Application Development.  
    System Development covers Board Support Package (BSP) development and kernel modification.  
    User Application Development covers development of applications that you intend to run on some 
    target hardware.  
</para>

<para>
    This chapter presents overviews of both system and application models.
    If you want to reference specific examples of these development models, 
    see <xref linkend='dev-manual-bsp-appendix'>BSP Development Example</xref> and 
    <xref linkend='dev-manual-kernel-appendix'>Kernel Modification Example</xref>.
</para>

<section id='system-development-model'>
    <title>System Development</title>

    <para>
        System development involves modification or creation of an image that you want to run on 
        a specific hardware target.  
        Usually when you want to create an image that runs on embedded hardware the image does 
        not require the same amount of features that a full-fledged Linux distribution provides.  
        Thus, you can create a much smaller image that is designed to just use the hardware 
        features for your particular hardware.
    </para>

    <para>
        To help you understand how system development works in the Yocto Project, this section 
        covers two types of image development:  BSP creation and kernel modification
        (see <xref linkend='kernel-spot'></xref>).
    </para>

    <section id='developing-a-board-support-package-bsp'>
        <title>Developing a Board Support Package (BSP)</title>

        <para>
            A BSP is a package of recipes that when applied during a build results in 
            an image you can run on a particular board.  
            Thus, the package, when compiled into the new image, supports the operation of the board.  
        </para>

            For a brief list of terms used when describing the development process in the Yocto Project, 
            see <xref linkend='yocto-project-terms'>Yocto Project Terms</xref> in this manual.
        </note>

        <para>
            The remainder of this section presents the basic steps to create a BSP basing it on an 
            existing BSP that ships with the Yocto Project.
            You can reference <xref linkend='dev-manual-bsp-appendix'>BSP Development Example</xref>
            for a detailed example that uses the Crown Bay BSP as a base BSP from which to start.

                    The Yocto Project ships with several BSPs that support various hardware.  
                    It is best to base your new BSP on an existing BSP rather than create all the 
                    recipes and configuration files from scratch.  
                    While it is possible to create everything from scratch, basing your new BSP 
                    on something that is close is much easier.  
                    Or, at a minimum, it gives you some structure with which to start.</para>
                    <para>At this point you need to understand your target hardware well enough to determine which 
                    existing BSP it most closely matches.  
                    Things to consider are your hardware’s on-board features such as CPU type and graphics support.  
                    You should look at the README files for supported BSPs to get an idea of which one 
                    you could use.  
                    A generic Atom-based BSP to consider is the Crown Bay that does not support
                    the Intel® Embedded Media Graphics Driver (EMGD).  
                    The remainder of this example uses that base BSP.</para>

                <listitem><para><emphasis>Create your own BSP layer</emphasis>:  Layers are ideal for 
                    isolating and storing work for a given piece of hardware.  
                    A layer is really just a location or area in which you place the recipes for your BSP.  
                    In fact, a BSP is, in itself, a special type of layer.   
                    Consider an application as another example that illustrates a layer.  
                    Suppose you are creating an application that has library or other dependencies in 
                    order for it to compile and run.  
                    The layer, in this case, would be where all the recipes that define those dependencies 
                    are kept.  The key point for a layer is that it is an isolated area that contains 
                    all the relevant information for the project that the Yocto Project build 
                    system knows about.</para>
                    <note>The Yocto Project supports four BSPs that are part of the 
                    Yocto Project release: <filename>atom-pc</filename>, <filename>beagleboard</filename>,
                    <filename>mpc8315e</filename>, and <filename>routerstationpro</filename>.  
                    The recipes and configurations for these four BSPs are located and dispersed 
                    within local Yocto Project files.
                    Consequently, they are not totally isolated in the spirit of layers unless you think 
                    of <filename>meta-yocto</filename> as a layer itself.  
                    On the other hand, BSP layers for Crown Bay, Emenlow, Jasper Forest, 
                    N450, and Sugar Bay are isolated.</note>
                    <para>When you set up a layer for a new BSP you should follow a standard layout.  
                    This layout is described in the

                    In the standard layout you will notice a suggested structure for recipes and  
                    configuration information.  
                    You can see the standard layout for the Crown Bay BSP in this example by examining the 
                    directory structure of the <filename>meta-crownbay</filename> layer inside the

        <title><anchor id='kernel-spot' />Modifying the Kernel</title>

        <para>
            Kernel modification involves changing the Linux Yocto kernel, which could involve changing
            configuration variables as well as adding new kernel recipes.  
            Configuration changes can be added in the form of configuration fragments, while recipe
            modification comes through the kernel's <filename>recipes-kernel</filename> area
            in a kernel layer you create.

            The remainder of this section presents a high-level overview of the Linux Yocto 
            kernel architecture and the steps to modify the Linux Yocto kernel.
            For a complete discussion of the kernel, see the 
            <ulink url='http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/1.1/kernel-manual/kernel-manual.html'>

            <title>Kernel Overview</title>

            <para>
                When one thinks of the source files for a kernel they usually think of a fixed structure 
                of files that contain kernel patches.
                The Yocto Project, however, employs mechanisims that in a sense result in a kernel source
                generator.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Yocto Project uses the source code management (SCM) tool Git to manage and track Yocto 
                Project files.
                Git employs branching strategies that effectively produce a tree-like structure whose 
                branches represent diversions from more general code. 
                For example, suppose two kernels are basically identical with the exception of a couple
                different features in each.
                In the Yocto Project source repositories managed by Git a main branch can contain the 
                common or shared
                parts of the kernel source and two branches that diverge from that common branch can 
                each contain the features specific to the respective kernel.
                The result is a managed tree whose "leaves" represent the end of a specific path that yields
                a set of kernel source files necessary for a specific piece of hardware and its features.
            </para>
         
            <para>
                A big advantage to this scheme is the sharing of common features by keeping them in 
                "larger" branches that are further up the tree.  
                This practice eliminates redundant storage of similar features shared among kernels.
            </para>

            <para>
                When you build the kernel on your development system all files needed for the build
                are taken from the Yocto Project source repositories pointed to by the 
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable and gathered in a temporary work area
                where they are subsequently used to create the unique kernel.
                Thus, in a sense, the process constructs a local source tree specific to your 
                kernel to generate the new kernel image - a source generator if you will.

                Within the interface you will see groups of related source code, each of which can 
                be cloned using Git to result in a working Git repository on your local system

                        system</emphasis>:  In order to make modifications to the kernel you need two things:
                        a bare clone of the Linux Yocto kernel you are modifying and a copy of that 
                        bare clone. 
                        The bare clone is required by the build process and is the area to which you 
                        push your kernel source changes. 
                        The copy of the bare clone is a local Git repository that contains all the kernel's 
                        source files. 
                        You make your changes to the files in this copy of the bare clone.
                        For information on how to set these two items up, see the bulleted item

                        changing source files. 
                        However, if you have to do this then you make the changes in the local 
                        Git repository you set up to hold the source files (i.e. the copy of the 
                        bare clone).
                        Once the changes are made you need to use Git commands to commit the changes
                        and then push them to the bare clone.</para></listitem>

                        If your situation calls for changing the kernel's configuration you can 
                        use <filename>menuconfig</filename>
                        to enable and disable kernel configurations.  
                        Using <filename>menuconfig</filename> allows you to develop and test the

                        If you need to add new kernel recipes you add them within this layer. 
                        Also within this area you will find the <filename>.bbappend</filename> 
                        file that appends information to the kernel's recipe file used during the

                        If you have not done so you need to get the build environment ready by sourcing 
                        the environment setup script described earlier.
                        You also need to be sure two key configuration files are configured appropriately.</para>
