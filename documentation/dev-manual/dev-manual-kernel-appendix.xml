<title>Kernel Modification Example</title>

    <para>
        Kernel modification involves changing or adding configurations to an existing kernel,  
        changing or adding recipes to the kernel that are needed to support specific hardware features, 
        or even altering the source code itself.  
        This appendix presents simple examples that modify the kernel source code, 
        change the kernel configuration, and add a kernel source recipe.
<!--        [WRITER'S NOTE:  I might want to work in information about applying a local
            change to a kernel layer and also pushing a change upstream into the tree]

        <para>
            This example adds some simple QEMU emulator console output at boot time by 
            adding <filename>printk</filename> statements to the kernel's
            <filename>calibrate.c</filename> source code file.
            Booting the modified image causes the added messages to appear on the emulator's
            console.

            <title>Understanding the Files You Need</title>
          
            <para>
                Before you modify the kernel, you need to know what Git repositories and file 
                structures you need.
                Briefly, you need the following: 
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>A local Yocto Project files Git repository</para></listitem>

                The following figure summarizes these four areas.  
                Within each rectangular that represents a data structure an URL appears at the 
                lower left-hand corner of the box.  
                These URLs are the locations used in this example.
                The figure also provides key statements and commands used during the kernel
                modification process:

                        This area contains all the metadata that supports building images in the 
                        Yocto Project build environment - the local Yocto Project files.
                        The Local Yocto Project files Git repository also contains the build directory
                        and a configuration directory that let you control the build.
                        Note also that in this example the repository also contains the 
                        <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git repository.</para>

                        You edit <filename>.bbappend</filename> files to locate your 
                        local kernel source files and to identify the kernel being built.
                        This Git repository is a gathering place for extensions to the Linux Yocto

                        When you modify the kernel you must work through a bare clone.
                        All source code changes you make to the kernel must be committed and 
                        pushed to the bare clone using Git commands.
                        As mentioned, the <filename>.bbappend</filename> file in the 
                        <filename>poky-extras</filename> repository points to the bare clone
                        so that the build process can locate the locally changed source files.</para>

            <para>
                You can get the local Yocto Project files through tarball extraction or by 
                cloning the <filename>poky</filename> Git repository.  
                This example uses <filename>poky</filename> as the root directory of the 
                local Yocto Project files Git repository.
                See the bulleted item
                <link linkend='local-yp-release'>Yocto Project Release</link> in

            <para>
                Once you have the repository set up, 
                you have many development branches from which you can work. 
                From inside the repository you can see the branch names and the tag names used 
                in the Git repository using either of the following two commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd poky
     $ git branch -a
     $ git tag -l
                </literallayout> 
                This example uses the Yocto Project 1.1_M3 Release, 
                which maps to the <filename>1.1_M3</filename> branch in the repository. 
                The following commands create and checkout the local <filename>1.1_M3</filename>
                branch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ git checkout -b 1.1_M3 origin/1.1_M3
     Branch 1.1_M3 set up to track remote branch 1.1_M3 from origin.
     Switched to a new branch '1.1_M3'

            <title>Setting Up the Bare Clone and its Copy</title>

            <para>
                This example modifies the <filename>linux-yocto-3.0</filename> kernel.
                Thus, you need to create a bare clone of that kernel and then make a copy of the 
                bare clone.
                See the bulleted item
                <link linkend='local-kernel-files'>Linux Yocto Kernel</link> in  
                <xref linkend='getting-setup'>Getting Setup</xref> earlier in this manual
                for information on how to do that.
            </para>

            <para>
                The bare clone exists for the kernel build tools and simply as the receiving end 
                of <filename>git push</filename>
                commands after you make edits and commits inside the copy of the clone.
                The copy (<filename>linux-yocto-3.0</filename> in this example) has to have 
                a local branch created and checked out for your work.
                This example uses <filename>common-pc-base</filename> as the local branch.
                The following commands create and checkout the branch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/linux-yocto-3.0
     $ git checkout -b common-pc-base origin/yocto/standard/common-pc/base
     Branch common-pc-base set up to track remote branch yocto/standard/common-pc/base from origin.
     Switched to a new branch 'common-pc-base'
                </literallayout>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='building-and-booting-the-default-qemu-kernel-image'>
            <title>Building and Booting the Default QEMU Kernel Image</title>

            <para>
                Before we make changes to the kernel source files, this example first builds the 
                default image and then boots it inside the QEMU emulator.
                <note>
                    Because a full build can take hours, you should check two variables in the 
                    <filename>build</filename> directory that is created after you source the 
                    <filename>oe-init-build-env</filename> script.
                    You can find these variables
                    <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> and <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename>
                    in the <filename>build/conf</filename> directory in the 
                    <filename>local.conf</filename> configuration file.
                    By default, these variables are commented out.
                    If your host development system supports multi-core and multi-thread capabilities,
                    you can uncomment these statements and set the variables to significantly shorten
                    the full build time.
                    As a guideline, set <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> to twice the number 
                    of cores your machine supports and set <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename> to one and 
                    a half times the number of cores your machine supports.
                </note>
                The following commands build the default <filename>qemux86</filename> image:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky
     $ source oe-init-build-env

          ### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

     You can now run 'bitbake &lt;target&gt;'

     Common targets are:
         core-image-minimal
         core-image-sato
         meta-toolchain
         meta-toolchain-sdk
         adt-installer
         meta-ide-support

     You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

     $ bitbake -k core-image-minimal
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The <filename>source</filename> command sets up the build environment and, 
                if necessary, creates the build directory.
                The following <filename>bitbake</filename> command starts the build.
                <note>Be sure to check the settings in the <filename>local.conf</filename>
                before starting the build.</note>
            </para>

            <para>  
                After the build completes, you can start the QEMU emulator using the resulting image
                <filename>qemux86</filename> as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ runqemu qemux86
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                As the image boots in the emulator, console message and status output appears
                across the terminal window.
                Because the output scrolls by quickly, it is difficult to read.
                To examine the output, you log into the system using the 
                login <filename>root</filename> with no password.
                Once you are logged in, issue the following command to scroll through the 
                console output:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # dmesg | less
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Take note of the output as you will want to look for your inserted print command output
                later in the example.

               Once the source code has been modified, you need to use Git to push the changes to 
               the bare clone.  
               If you do not push the changes, then the Yocto Project build system will not pick 
               up the changed source files.

               The example now defines some variables used by the Yocto Project build system

               You essentially need to identify where to find the kernel recipe and the changed source code.
               You also need to be sure some basic configurations are in place that identify the 
               type of machine you are building and to help speed up the build should your host support
               multiple-core and thread capabilities.

                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
I entered runqemu qemux86 and it fires upthis fires up the emulator and uses the
image and filesystem in the build area created in the previous section.

Then I copied over a pre-created and formated 5.2MB VFAT file named vfat.img.
I did this with scp vfat.img root@192.168.7.2:
The file is in the root directory.
I had to do this because the mkfs.vfat vfat.img command does not work.
mkfs is not recognized in the qemu terminal session.

when I try mount -o loop -t vfat vfat.img mnt/ I get the error
mount: can't set up loop device: No space left on device.
This error is because the loop module is not currently in the kernel image.
However, this module is available in the 
build area in the tarball modules-2.6.37.6-yocto-starndard+-20-qemux86.tgz.
You can add this to the kernel image by adding the 
IMAGE_INSTALL += " kernel-module-loop" statement at the top of the local.conf
file in the build area and then rebuilding the kernel using bitbake.
It should just build whatever is necessary and not go through an entire build again.

                Once menuconfig fires up you see all kinds of categories that you can interactively
                investigate.
                If they have an "M" in it then the feature is "modularized".
                I guess that means that means that it needs to be manually linked in when the 
                kernel is booted??? (Not sure).
                If they have an "*" then the feature is automatically part of the kernel.]

                So the tmp/work/ area was created in poky and there is a .config file in there and
                a .config.old file.  
                The old one must have been created when I exited from menuconfig after poking around 
                a bit.
                Nope - appears to just be created automatically.

            <para>
                A good practice is to first determine what configurations you have for the kernel.
                You can see the results by looking in the .config file in the build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux area
                of the local YP files. 
                There is a directory named linux-yocto-2.6.37* in the directory.
                In that directory is a directory named linux-qemux86-standard-build.
                In that directory you will find a file named .config that is the configuration file
                for the kernel that will be used when you build the kernel.
                You can open that file up and examine it. 
                If you do a search for "VFAT" you will see that that particular configuration is not 
                enabled for the kernel.
                This means that you cannot print a VFAT text file, or for that matter, even mount one
                from the image if you were to build it at this point.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can prove the point by actually trying it at this point.

EXTRA STUFF I MIGHT NEED BUT NOW SURE RIGHT NOW.

In the standard layer structure you have several areas that you need to examine or 
                    modify.
                    For this example the layer contains four areas:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>conf</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        <filename>layer.conf</filename> that identifies the location of the recipe files. 
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>images</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        image recipe file. 
                        This recipe includes the base image you will be using and specifies other 
                        packages the image might need.</para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>recipes-bsp</filename></emphasis> - Contains 
                        recipes specific to the hardware for which you are developing the kernel.
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>recipes-kernel</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        "append" files that add information to the main recipe kernel.  
                        </para></listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>

                <para>
                    Let's take a look at the <filename>layer.conf</filename> in the 
                    <filename>conf</filename> directory first.
                    This configuration file enables the Yocto Project build system to locate and 
                    use the information in your new layer.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The variable <filename>BBPATH</filename> needs to include the path to your layer
                    as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBPATH := "${BBPATH}:${LAYERDIR}"
                    </literallayout>
                    And, the variable <filename>BBFILES</filename> needs to be modified to include your 
                    recipe and append files:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBFILES := "${BBFILES} ${LAYERDIR}/images/*.bb \ 
        ${LAYERDIR}/images/*.bbappend \
        ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
        ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"
                    </literallayout>
                    Finally, you need to be sure to use your layer name in these variables at the 
                    end of the file:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "elc"
     BBFILE_PATTERN_elc := "^${LAYERDIR}/"
     BBFILE_PRIORITY_elc = "9"
                   </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    The <filename>images</filename> directory contains an append file that helps 
                    further define the image.
                    In our example, the base image is <filename>core-image-minimal</filename>.  
                    The image does, however, need some additional modules that we are using
                    for this example.
                    These modules support the amixer functionality.
                    Here is the append file:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     require recipes-core/images/poky-image-minimal.bb

     IMAGE_INSTALL += "dropbear alsa-utils-aplay alsa-utils-alsamixer"
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append_qemux86 += " kernel-module-snd-ens1370 \
        kernel-module-snd-rawmidi kernel-module-loop kernel-module-nls-cp437 \
        kernel-module-nls-iso8859-1 qemux86-audio alsa-utils-amixer"

     LICENSE = "MIT"
                   </literallayout>
               </para>

               <para>
                   While the focus of this example is not on the BSP, it is worth mentioning that the
                   <filename>recipes-bsp</filename> directory has the recipes and append files for 
                   features that the hardware requires. 
                   In this example, there is a script and a recipe to support the 
                   <filename>amixer</filename> functionality in QEMU.
                   It is beyond the scope of this manual to go too deeply into the script.
                   Suffice it to say that the script tests for the presence of the mixer, sets up 
                   default mixer values, enables the mixer, unmutes master and then 
                   sets the volume to 100.
               </para>

               <para>
                   The recipe <filename>qemu86-audio.bb</filename> installs and runs the 
                   <filename>amixer</filename> when the system boots.
                   Here is the recipe:
                   <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SUMMARY = "Provide a basic init script to enable audio"
     DESCRIPTION = "Set the volume and unmute the Front mixer setting during boot."

     inherit update-rc.d

     RDEPENDS = "alsa-utils-amixer"

     SRC_URI = "file://qemux86-audio"

     INITSCRIPT_NAME = "qemux86-audio"
     INITSCRIPT_PARAMS = "defaults 90"

     do_install() {
	     install -d ${D}${sysconfdir} \
     	           ${D}${sysconfdir}/init.d
     	install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/qemux86-audio ${D}${sysconfdir}/init.d
             cat ${WORKDIR}/${INITSCRIPT_NAME} | \

     }

                </para>

                <para>
                    The last area to look at is <filename>recipes-kernel</filename>.
                    This area holds configuration fragments and kernel append files.
                    The append file must have the same name as the kernel recipe, which is 
                    <filename>linux-yocto-2.6.37</filename> in this example.
                    The file can <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statements to point to configuration 
                    fragments you might have in the layer. 
                    The file can also contain <filename>KERNEL_FEATURES</filename> statements that specify
                    included kernel configurations that ship with the Yocto Project.
