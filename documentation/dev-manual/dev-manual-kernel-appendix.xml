<title>Kernel Modification Example</title>

    <para>
        Kernel modification involves changing or adding configurations to an existing kernel,  
        changing or adding recipes to the kernel that are needed to support specific hardware features, 
        or even altering the source code itself.  
        This appendix presents simple examples that modify the kernel source code, 
        change the kernel configuration, and add a kernel source recipe.

        <title>Modifying the Kernel Source Code</title>

        <para>
            This example adds some simple QEMU emulator console output at boot time by 
            adding <filename>printk</filename> statements to the kernel's
            <filename>calibrate.c</filename> source code file.
            Booting the modified image causes the added messages to appear on the emulator's
            console.

            <title>Understanding the Files You Need</title>
          
            <para>
                Before you modify the kernel, you need to know what Git repositories and file 
                structures you need.
                Briefly, you need the following: 
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>A local 
                        <link linkend='source-directory'>source directory</link> for the 
                        poky Git repository</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para>Local copies of the

                        Git repository placed within the source directory.</para></listitem>  
                    <listitem><para>A bare clone of the 
                        <link linkend='local-kernel-files'>Yocto Project Kernel</link> upstream Git 
                        repository to which you want to push your modifications.

            </para>

            <para> 
                The following figure summarizes these four areas.  
                Within each rectangular that represents a data structure, a  
                host development directory pathname appears at the 
                lower left-hand corner of the box.  
                These pathnames are the locations used in this example.
                The figure also provides key statements and commands used during the kernel
                modification process:

            <para>
                Here is a brief description of the four areas:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Local Source Directory:</emphasis> 
                        This area contains all the metadata that supports building images 
                        using the OpenEmbedded build system.
                        In this example, the source directory also 
                        contains the build directory, which contains the configuration directory 
                        that lets you control the build.
                        Also in this example, the source directory contains local copies of the 
                        <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git repository.</para>
                        <para>See the bulleted item

                        for information on how to get these files on your local system.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Local copies of the<filename>poky-extras</filename> 
                        Git Repository:</emphasis> 
                        This area contains the <filename>meta-kernel-dev</filename> layer, 
                        which is where you make changes that append the kernel build recipes.
                        You edit <filename>.bbappend</filename> files to locate your 
                        local kernel source files and to identify the kernel being built.
                        This Git repository is a gathering place for extensions to the Yocto Project
                        (or really any) kernel recipes that faciliate the creation and development
                        of kernel features, BSPs or configurations.</para>
                        <para>See the bulleted item

                        for information on how to get these files.</para></listitem>                
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Bare Clone of the Yocto Project kernel:</emphasis> 
                        This bare Git repository tracks the upstream Git repository of the Linux 
                        Yocto kernel source code you are changing.
                        When you modify the kernel you must work through a bare clone.
                        All source code changes you make to the kernel must be committed and 
                        pushed to the bare clone using Git commands.
                        As mentioned, the <filename>.bbappend</filename> file in the 
                        <filename>poky-extras</filename> repository points to the bare clone
                        so that the build process can locate the locally changed source files.</para>

                        </para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Copy of the Yocto Project Kernel Bare Clone:</emphasis>
                        This Git repository contains the actual source files that you modify.  
                        Any changes you make to files in this location need to ultimately be pushed

                        <note>Typically, Git workflows follow a scheme where changes made to a local area 
                        are pulled into a Git repository.
                        However, because the <filename>git pull</filename> command does not work 
                        with bare clones, this workflow pushes changes to the 
                        repository even though you could use other more complicated methods to

            <title>Setting Up the Local Source Directory</title>

            <para>
                You can set up the source directory through tarball extraction or by 
                cloning the <filename>poky</filename> Git repository.  
                This example uses <filename>poky</filename> as the root directory of the 
                local source directory.
                See the bulleted item
                "<link linkend='local-yp-release'>Yocto Project Release</link>"
                for information on how to get these files.
            </para>

            <para>
                Once you have source directory set up, 
                you have many development branches from which you can work. 
                From inside the local repository you can see the branch names and the tag names used 
                in the upstream Git repository by using either of the following commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd poky
     $ git branch -a
     $ git tag -l
                </literallayout> 
                This example uses the Yocto Project &DISTRO; Release code named "&DISTRO_NAME;", 
                which maps to the <filename>&DISTRO_NAME;</filename> branch in the repository. 
                The following commands create and checkout the local <filename>&DISTRO_NAME;</filename>
                branch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ git checkout -b &DISTRO_NAME; origin/&DISTRO_NAME;
     Branch &DISTRO_NAME; set up to track remote branch &DISTRO_NAME; from origin.
     Switched to a new branch '&DISTRO_NAME;'

            <title>Setting Up the Local poky-extras Git Repository</title>

            <para>
                This example creates a local copy of the <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git 
                repository inside the <filename>poky</filename> source directory.
                See the bulleted item "<link linkend='poky-extras-repo'>The 
                <filename>poky-extras</filename> Git Repository</link>" 
                for information on how to set up a local copy of the
                <filename>poky-extras</filename> repository.
            </para>

            <para>
                Because this example uses the Yocto Project &DISTRO; Release code 
                named "&DISTRO_NAME;", which maps to the <filename>&DISTRO_NAME;</filename> 
                branch in the repository, you need to be sure you are using that 
                branch for <filename>poky-extra</filename>.
                The following commands create and checkout the local

            <title>Setting Up the Bare Clone and its Copy</title>

            <para>
                This example modifies the <filename>linux-yocto-3.2</filename> kernel.
                Thus, you need to create a bare clone of that kernel and then make a copy of the 
                bare clone.
                See the bulleted item
                "<link linkend='local-kernel-files'>Yocto Project Kernel</link>" 
                for information on how to do that.
            </para>

            <para>
                The bare clone exists for the kernel build tools and simply as the receiving end 
                of <filename>git push</filename>
                commands after you make edits and commits inside the copy of the clone.
                The copy (<filename>my-linux-yocto-3.2-work</filename> in this example) has to have 
                a local branch created and checked out for your work.
                This example uses <filename>common-pc-base</filename> as the local branch.
                The following commands create and checkout the branch:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/my-linux-yocto-3.2-work
     $ git checkout -b common-pc-base origin/standard/default/common-pc/base

     Branch common-pc-base set up to track remote branch 
        standard/default/common-pc/base from origin.
     Switched to a new branch 'common-pc-base'

        <section id='building-and-booting-the-default-qemu-kernel-image'>
            <title>Building and Booting the Default QEMU Kernel Image</title>

            <para>
                Before we make changes to the kernel source files, this example first builds the 
                default image and then boots it inside the QEMU emulator.
                <note>
                    Because a full build can take hours, you should check two variables in the 
                    <filename>build</filename> directory that is created after you source the 
                    <filename>oe-init-build-env</filename> script.
                    You can find these variables
                    <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> and <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename>
                    in the <filename>build/conf</filename> directory in the 
                    <filename>local.conf</filename> configuration file.
                    By default, these variables are commented out.
                    If your host development system supports multi-core and multi-thread capabilities,
                    you can uncomment these statements and set the variables to significantly shorten
                    the full build time.
                    As a guideline, set both <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> and 
                    <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename> to twice the number 
                    of cores your machine supports.
                </note>
                The following two commands <filename>source</filename> the build environment setup script
                and build the default <filename>qemux86</filename> image.
                If necessary, the script creates the build directory:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky
     $ source oe-init-build-env

          ### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

     You can now run 'bitbake &lt;target&gt;'

     Common targets are:
         core-image-minimal
         core-image-sato
         meta-toolchain
         meta-toolchain-sdk
         adt-installer
         meta-ide-support

     You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The following <filename>bitbake</filename> command starts the build:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -k core-image-minimal
                </literallayout>
                <note>Be sure to check the settings in the <filename>local.conf</filename>
                before starting the build.</note>
            </para>

            <para>  
                After the build completes, you can start the QEMU emulator using the resulting image
                <filename>qemux86</filename> as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ runqemu qemux86
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                As the image boots in the emulator, console message and status output appears
                across the terminal window.
                Because the output scrolls by quickly, it is difficult to read.
                To examine the output, you log into the system using the 
                login <filename>root</filename> with no password.
                Once you are logged in, issue the following command to scroll through the 
                console output:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # dmesg | less
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Take note of the output as you will want to look for your inserted print command output
                later in the example.

               After making and saving your changes, you need to stage them for the push.
               The following Git commands are one method of staging and committing your changes:

               Once the source code has been modified, you need to use Git to push the changes to 
               the bare clone.  
               If you do not push the changes, then the OpenEmbedded build system will not pick 
               up the changed source files.
           </para>

               The example now defines some variables used by the OpenEmbedded build system

               You essentially need to identify where to find the kernel recipe and the changed source code.
               You also need to be sure some basic configurations are in place that identify the 
               type of machine you are building and to help speed up the build should your host support
               multiple-core and thread capabilities.

                If you don't have the source directory established on your system,

            <para>
                Once you have the local copy of the repository set up, 
                you have many development branches from which you can work. 
                From inside the repository you can see the branch names and the tag names used 
                in the upstream Git repository using either of the following commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd poky

                This example uses the Yocto Project &DISTRO; Release code named "&DISTRO_NAME;", 
                which maps to the <filename>&DISTRO_NAME;</filename> branch in the repository. 
                The following commands create and checkout the local <filename>&DISTRO_NAME;</filename>

                Next, you need to build the default <filename>qemux86</filename> image that you

                <note>
                    Because a full build can take hours, you should check two variables in the 
                    <filename>build</filename> directory that is created after you source the 
                    <filename>oe-init-build-env</filename> script.
                    You can find these variables
                    <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> and <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename>
                    in the <filename>build/conf</filename> directory in the 
                    <filename>local.conf</filename> configuration file.
                    By default, these variables are commented out.
                    If your host development system supports multi-core and multi-thread capabilities,
                    you can uncomment these statements and set the variables to significantly shorten
                    the full build time.
                    As a guideline, set both the <filename>BB_NUMBER_THREADS</filename> and the 
                    <filename>PARALLEL_MAKE</filename> variables to twice the number 
                    of cores your machine supports.

                To see this default setting from within the QEMU emulator, boot your image using

                The emulator reports support for the number of processors you specified using

                If you have not sourced this script do so with the following commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~/poky
     $ source oe-init-build-env
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                After setting up the environment to run <filename>menuconfig</filename>, you are ready 
                to use the tool to interactively change the kernel configuration.
                In this example, we are basing our changes on the <filename>linux-yocto-3.2</filename>
                kernel.
                The OpenEmbedded build system recognizes this kernel as 
                <filename>linux-yocto</filename>.
                Thus, the following commands from the shell in which you previously sourced the 
                environment initialization script cleans the shared state cache and the 
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>
                directory and then builds and launches <filename>menuconfig</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c menuconfig
                </literallayout>
            </para>
                  
            <para>
                Once <filename>menuconfig</filename> launches, navigate through the user interface
                to find the <filename>CONFIG_SMP</filename> configuration setting.
                You can find it at <filename>Processor Type and Features</filename>.
                The configuration selection is 
                <filename>Symmetric Multi-processing Support</filename>.
                After using the arrow keys to highlight this selection, press "n" to turn it off.
                Then, exit out and save your selections.
            </para>

            <para>
                Once you save the selection, the <filename>.config</filename> configuration file
                is updated. 
                This is the file that the build system uses to configure the Yocto Project kernel
                when it is built. 
                You can find and examine this file in the build directory. 
                This example uses the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     ~/poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/linux-yocto-3.2.11+git1+84f...
        ...656ed30-r1/linux-qemux86-standard-build
                </literallayout>
                <note>
                    The previous example directory is artificially split and many of the characters 
                    in the actual filename are omitted in order to make it more readable.
                    Also, depending on the kernel you are using, the exact pathname might differ 
                    slightly.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                Within the <filename>.config</filename> file, you can see the following setting:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # CONFIG_SMP is not set
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                A good method to isolate changed configurations is to use a combination of the 
                <filename>menuconfig</filename> tool and simple shell commands.
                Before changing configurations with <filename>menuconfig</filename>, copy the 
                existing <filename>.config</filename> and rename it to something else,
                use <filename>menuconfig</filename> to make 
                as many changes an you want and save them, then compare the renamed configuration 
                file against the newly created file.
                You can use the resulting differences as your base to create configuration fragments
                to permanently save in your kernel layer.
                <note>
                    Be sure to make a copy of the <filename>.config</filename> and don't just
                    rename it. 
                    The build system needs an existing <filename>.config</filename>
                    from which to work.

            <para>
                At this point, you are ready to recompile your kernel image with 
                the new setting in effect using the BitBake command below:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake linux-yocto
                </literallayout>
            </para>
 
            <para>
                Now run the QEMU emulator and pass it the same multi-processor option as before:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ runqemu qemux86 qemuparams="-smp 4"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Login to the machine using <filename>root</filename> with no password
                and test for the number of processors the kernel supports:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor 
     processor       : 0
     #
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                From the output, you can see that the kernel no longer supports multi-processor systems.
                The output indicates support for a single processor.  You can verify the 
                <filename>CONFIG_SMP</filename> setting by using this command:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_SMP
                </literallayout>
                The console returns the following output:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     # CONFIG_SMP is not set
                </literallayout>
                You have successfully reconfigured the kernel.
