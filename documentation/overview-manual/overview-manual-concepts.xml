<title>Yocto Project Concepts</title>

    <para>
        This chapter provides explanations for Yocto Project concepts that
        go beyond the surface of "how-to" information and reference (or
        look-up) material.
        Concepts such as components, the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
        workflow, cross-development toolchains, shared state cache, and so
        forth are explained.

        <para>
            BitBake handles the parsing and execution of the data files.
            The data itself is of various types:

                    so forth.
                    Configuration data acts as the glue to bind everything

        <para>
            BitBake knows how to combine multiple data sources together and
            refers to each data source as a layer.
            For information on layers, see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#understanding-and-creating-layers'>Understanding and Creating Layers</ulink>"
            section of the Yocto Project Development Tasks Manual.
        </para>

        <para>
            Following are some brief details on these core components.
            For additional information on how these components interact during
            a build, see the
            "<link linkend='openembedded-build-system-build-concepts'>OpenEmbedded Build System Concepts</link>"

            <title>BitBake</title>

            <para>
                BitBake is the tool at the heart of the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
                and is responsible for parsing the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>,
                generating a list of tasks from it, and then executing those
                tasks.
            </para>

            <para>
                This section briefly introduces BitBake.
                If you want more information on BitBake, see the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#bitbake-user-manual'>BitBake User Manual</ulink>.
            </para>

            <para>
                To see a list of the options BitBake supports, use either of
                the following commands:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake -h
     $ bitbake --help
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The most common usage for BitBake is
                <filename>bitbake <replaceable>packagename</replaceable></filename>,
                where <filename>packagename</filename> is the name of the
                package you want to build (referred to as the "target").
                The target often equates to the first part of a recipe's
                filename (e.g. "foo" for a recipe named
                <filename>foo_1.3.0-r0.bb</filename>).
                So, to process the
                <filename>matchbox-desktop_1.2.3.bb</filename> recipe file, you
                might type the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop
                </literallayout>
                Several different versions of
                <filename>matchbox-desktop</filename> might exist.
                BitBake chooses the one selected by the distribution
                configuration.
                You can get more details about how BitBake chooses between
                different target versions and providers in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#bb-bitbake-preferences'>Preferences</ulink>"
                section of the BitBake User Manual.
            </para>

            <para>
                BitBake also tries to execute any dependent tasks first.
                So for example, before building
                <filename>matchbox-desktop</filename>, BitBake would build a
                cross compiler and <filename>glibc</filename> if they had not
                already been built.
            </para>

            <para>
                A useful BitBake option to consider is the
                <filename>-k</filename> or <filename>--continue</filename>
                option.
                This option instructs BitBake to try and continue processing
                the job as long as possible even after encountering an error.
                When an error occurs, the target that failed and those that
                depend on it cannot be remade.
                However, when you use this option other dependencies can
                still be processed.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='overview-components-recipes'>
            <title>Recipes</title>

            <para>
                Files that have the <filename>.bb</filename> suffix are
                "recipes" files.
                In general, a recipe contains information about a single piece
                of software.
                This information includes the location from which to download
                the unaltered source, any source patches to be applied to that
                source (if needed), which special configuration options to
                apply, how to compile the source files, and how to package the
                compiled output.
            </para>

            <para>
                The term "package" is sometimes used to refer to recipes.
                However, since the word "package" is used for the packaged
                output from the OpenEmbedded build system (i.e.
                <filename>.ipk</filename> or <filename>.deb</filename> files),
                this document avoids using the term "package" when referring
                to recipes.

        <section id='overview-components-classes'>
            <title>Classes</title>

            <para>
                Class files (<filename>.bbclass</filename>) contain information
                that is useful to share between recipes files.
                An example is the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-autotools'><filename>autotools</filename></ulink>
                class, which contains common settings for any application that
                Autotools uses.
                The
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes'>Classes</ulink>"
                chapter in the Yocto Project Reference Manual provides
                details about classes and how to use them.

        <section id='overview-components-configurations'>
            <title>Configurations</title>

            <para>
                The configuration files (<filename>.conf</filename>) define
                various configuration variables that govern the OpenEmbedded
                build process.
                These files fall into several areas that define machine
                configuration options, distribution configuration options,
                compiler tuning options, general common configuration options,
                and user configuration options in
                <filename>conf/local.conf</filename>, which is found in the

    <section id='overview-layers'>
        <title>Layers</title>

        <para>
            Layers are repositories that contain related metadata (i.e.
            sets of instructions) that tell the OpenEmbedded build system how
            to build a target.
            Yocto Project's
            <link linkend='the-yocto-project-layer-model'>layer model</link>
            facilitates collaboration, sharing, customization, and reuse
            within the Yocto Project development environment.
            Layers logically separate information for your project.
            For example, you can use a layer to hold all the configurations
            for a particular piece of hardware.
            Isolating hardware-specific configurations allows you to share
            other metadata by using a different layer where that metadata
            might be common across several pieces of hardware.
        </para>

        <para>
            Many layers exist that work in the Yocto Project development
            environment.
            The
            <ulink url='https://caffelli-staging.yoctoproject.org/software-overview/layers/'>Yocto Project Curated Layer Index</ulink>
            and
            <ulink url='http://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/'>OpenEmbedded Layer Index</ulink>
            both contain layers from which you can use or leverage.
        </para>

        <para>
            By convention, layers in the Yocto Project follow a specific form.
            Conforming to a known structure allows BitBake to make assumptions
            during builds on where to find types of metadata.
            You can find procedures and learn about tools (i.e.
            <filename>bitbake-layers</filename>) for creating layers suitable
            for the Yocto Project in the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#understanding-and-creating-layers'>Understanding and Creating Layers</ulink>"

            <para>
                User configuration helps define the build.
                Through user configuration, you can tell BitBake the
                target architecture for which you are building the image,
                where to store downloaded source, and other build properties.

            <para>
                BitBake needs some basic configuration files in order to
                complete a build.
                These files are <filename>*.conf</filename> files.
                The minimally necessary ones reside as example files in the
                <filename>build/conf</filename> directory of the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>.
                For simplicity, this section refers to the Source Directory as
                the "Poky Directory."
            </para>

            <para>
                When you clone the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#poky'>Poky</ulink>
                Git repository or you download and unpack a Yocto Project
                release, you can set up the Source Directory to be named
                anything you want.
                For this discussion, the cloned repository uses the default
                name <filename>poky</filename>.
                <note>
                    The Poky repository is primarily an aggregation of existing
                    repositories.
                    It is not a canonical upstream source.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                The <filename>meta-poky</filename> layer inside Poky contains
                a <filename>conf</filename> directory that has example
                configuration files.
                These example files are used as a basis for creating actual
                configuration files when you source
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-core-script'><filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename></ulink>,
                which is the build environment script.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sourcing the build environment script creates a
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>
                if one does not already exist.
                BitBake uses the Build Directory for all its work during
                builds.
                The Build Directory has a <filename>conf</filename> directory
                that contains default versions of your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> and
                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> configuration files.
                These default configuration files are created only if versions
                do not already exist in the Build Directory at the time you

                Because the Poky repository is fundamentally an aggregation of
                existing repositories, some users might be familiar with
                running the <filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename> script
                in the context of separate
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#oe-core'>OpenEmbedded-Core</ulink>
                and BitBake repositories rather than a single Poky repository.
                This discussion assumes the script is executed from
                within a cloned or unpacked version of Poky.

                Depending on where the script is sourced, different
                sub-scripts are called to set up the Build Directory
                (Yocto or OpenEmbedded).
                Specifically, the script
                <filename>scripts/oe-setup-builddir</filename> inside the
                poky directory sets up the Build Directory and seeds the
                directory (if necessary) with configuration files appropriate
                for the Yocto Project development environment.
                <note>
                    The <filename>scripts/oe-setup-builddir</filename> script
                    uses the <filename>$TEMPLATECONF</filename> variable to
                    determine which sample configuration files to locate.

                The <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file tells BitBake what
                layers you want considered during the build.
                By default, the layers listed in this file include layers
                minimally needed by the build system.
                However, you must manually add any custom layers you have
                created.
                You can find more information on working with the
                <filename>bblayers.conf</filename> file in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#enabling-your-layer'>Enabling Your Layer</ulink>"
                section in the Yocto Project Development Tasks Manual.

            <para>
                The files <filename>site.conf</filename> and
                <filename>auto.conf</filename> are not created by the
                environment initialization script.
                If you want the <filename>site.conf</filename> file, you
                need to create that yourself.
                The <filename>auto.conf</filename> file is typically created by
                an autobuilder:
                <itemizedlist>

                        <emphasis><filename>site.conf</filename>:</emphasis>
                        You can use the <filename>conf/site.conf</filename>
                        configuration file to configure multiple
                        build directories.
                        For example, suppose you had several build environments
                        and they shared some common features.
                        You can set these default build properties here.
                        A good example is perhaps the packaging format to use
                        through the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES'><filename>PACKAGE_CLASSES</filename></ulink>
                        variable.</para>

                        <para>One useful scenario for using the
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename> file is to extend
                        your
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBPATH'><filename>BBPATH</filename></ulink>
                        variable to include the path to a
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename>.
                        Then, when BitBake looks for Metadata using
                        <filename>BBPATH</filename>, it finds the
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename> file and applies
                        your common configurations found in the file.
                        To override configurations in a particular build
                        directory, alter the similar configurations within
                        that build directory's
                        <filename>conf/local.conf</filename> file.

                        The settings put into the file are typically the
                        same as you would find in the
                        <filename>conf/local.conf</filename> or the
                        <filename>conf/site.conf</filename> files.

                You can edit all configuration files to further define
                any particular build environment.
                This process is represented by the "User Configuration Edits"

            <para>
                When you launch your build with the
                <filename>bitbake <replaceable>target</replaceable></filename>
                command, BitBake sorts out the configurations to ultimately
                define your build environment.
                It is important to understand that the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
                reads the configuration files in a specific order:
                <filename>site.conf</filename>, <filename>auto.conf</filename>,
                and <filename>local.conf</filename>.
                And, the build system applies the normal assignment statement
                rules as described in the
                "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#bitbake-user-manual-metadata'>Syntax and Operators</ulink>"
                chapter of the BitBake User Manual.
                Because the files are parsed in a specific order, variable
                assignments for the same variable could be affected.
                For example, if the <filename>auto.conf</filename> file and
                the <filename>local.conf</filename> set
                <replaceable>variable1</replaceable> to different values,
                because the build system parses <filename>local.conf</filename>
                after <filename>auto.conf</filename>,
                <replaceable>variable1</replaceable> is assigned the value from
                the <filename>local.conf</filename> file.

                            When your recipes inherit a class, they take on the

            <title>Sources</title>

            <para>
                In order for the OpenEmbedded build system to create an
                image or any target, it must be able to access source files.
                The
                <link linkend='general-workflow-figure'>general workflow figure</link>
                represents source files using the "Upstream Project Releases",
                "Local Projects", and "SCMs (optional)" boxes.
                The figure represents mirrors, which also play a role in
                locating source files, with the "Source Mirror(s)" box.
            </para>

            <para>
                The method by which source files are ultimately organized is
                a function of the project.
                For example, for released software, projects tend to use
                tarballs or other archived files that can capture the
                state of a release guaranteeing that it is statically
                represented.
                On the other hand, for a project that is more dynamic or
                experimental in nature, a project might keep source files in a
                repository controlled by a Source Control Manager (SCM) such as
                Git.
                Pulling source from a repository allows you to control
                the point in the repository (the revision) from which you
                want to build software.
                Finally, a combination of the two might exist, which would
                give the consumer a choice when deciding where to get
                source files.
            </para>

            <para>
                BitBake uses the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></ulink>
                variable to point to source files regardless of their location.
                Each recipe must have a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable
                that points to the source.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another area that plays a significant role in where source
                files come from is pointed to by the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-DL_DIR'><filename>DL_DIR</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                This area is a cache that can hold previously downloaded
                source.
                You can also instruct the OpenEmbedded build system to create
                tarballs from Git repositories, which is not the default
                behavior, and store them in the <filename>DL_DIR</filename>
                by using the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS'><filename>BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS</filename></ulink>
                variable.
            </para>

            <para>
                Judicious use of a <filename>DL_DIR</filename> directory can
                save the build system a trip across the Internet when looking
                for files.
                A good method for using a download directory is to have
                <filename>DL_DIR</filename> point to an area outside of your
                Build Directory.
                Doing so allows you to safely delete the Build Directory
                if needed without fear of removing any downloaded source file.

                    Upstream project releases exist anywhere in the form of an
                    archived file (e.g. tarball or zip file).
                    These files correspond to individual recipes.
                    For example, the figure uses specific releases each for
                    BusyBox, Qt, and Dbus.
                    An archive file can be for any released product that can be

                    provides.
                    These bits reside somewhere local to a project - perhaps
                    a directory into which the user checks in items (e.g.
                    a local directory containing a development source tree

                    variables point to these, respectively.
                    BitBake checks pre-mirrors before looking upstream for any
                    source files.
                    Pre-mirrors are appropriate when you have a shared

            <para>
                When the OpenEmbedded build system generates an image or an

            <para>
                This section looks a little closer into the package feeds
                area used by the build system.
                Here is a more detailed look at the area:

            </para>

            <para>
                Package feeds are an intermediary step in the build process.
                The OpenEmbedded build system provides classes to generate
                different package types, and you specify which classes to
                enable through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES'><filename>PACKAGE_CLASSES</filename></ulink>
                variable.
                Before placing the packages into package feeds,
                the build process validates them with generated output quality
                assurance checks through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-insane'><filename>insane</filename></ulink>

            <para>
                The package feed area resides in the Build Directory.
                The directory the build system uses to temporarily store
                packages is determined by a combination of variables and the
                particular package manager in use.
                See the "Package Feeds" box in the illustration and note the
                information to the right of that area.

                    OpenEmbedded build system analyzes
                    the results and splits the output into packages:

                    packages and files.
                    The analyzing process involves the following as well as
                    other items: splitting out debugging symbols, looking at
                    shared library dependencies between packages, and looking
                    at package relationships.
                    The <filename>do_packagedata</filename> task creates
                    package metadata based on the analysis such that the
                    OpenEmbedded build system can generate the final packages.
                    Working, staged, and intermediate results of the analysis

                        Creating such feeds usually requires some kind of feed
                        maintenance mechanism that would upload the new

                    Once packages are split and stored in the Package Feeds
                    area, the OpenEmbedded build system uses BitBake to
                    generate the root filesystem image:

                    whether or not package management is enabled for the
                    target.
                    At the end of the process, if package management is not
                    enabled for the target, the package manager's data files
                    are deleted from the root filesystem.
                    As part of the final stage of package installation,
                    postinstall scripts that are part of the packages are run.
                    Any scripts that fail to run

                    After the root filesystem is built, processing begins on
                    the image through the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-image'><filename>do_image</filename></ulink>
                    task.
                    The build system runs any pre-processing commands as
                    defined by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND'><filename>IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND</filename></ulink>
                    variable.
                    This variable specifies a list of functions to call before
                    the OpenEmbedded build system creates the final image
                    output files.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The OpenEmbedded build system dynamically creates
                    <filename>do_image_*</filename> tasks as needed, based
                    on the image types specified in the

                    variable.
                    The process turns everything into an image file or a set of
                    image files and can compress the root filesystem image to
                    reduce the overall size of the image.
                    The formats used for the root filesystem depend on the
                    <filename>IMAGE_FSTYPES</filename> variable.
                    Compression depends on whether the formats support
                    compression.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As an example, a dynamically created task when creating a
                    particular image <replaceable>type</replaceable> would
                    take the following form:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     do_image_<replaceable>type</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                    So, if the <replaceable>type</replaceable> as specified by
                    the <filename>IMAGE_FSTYPES</filename> were
                    <filename>ext4</filename>, the dynamically generated task
                    would be as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     do_image_ext4
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                    task.
                    This task completes the image by applying any image

                        The entire image generation process is run under
                        Pseudo.
                        Running under Pseudo ensures that the files in the

                    Like image generation, the SDK script process consists of
                    several stages and depends on many variables.
                    The <filename>do_populate_sdk</filename> and
                    <filename>do_populate_sdk_ext</filename> tasks use these

                    The <filename>do_populate_sdk</filename> task helps create
                    the standard SDK and handles two parts: a target part and a
                    host part.
                    The target part is the part built for the target hardware
                    and includes libraries and headers.
                    The host part is the part of the SDK that runs on the

                    create the extensible SDK and handles host and target parts
                    differently than its counter part does for the standard SDK.
                    For the extensible SDK, the task encapsulates the build

                    Regardless of the type of SDK being constructed, the

                    environment setup script and any needed configuration files
                    are created.
                    The final output is the Cross-development

                <title>Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks</title>

                <para>
                    For each task that completes successfully, BitBake writes a
                    stamp file into the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-STAMPS_DIR'><filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename></ulink>
                    directory.
                    The beginning of the stamp file's filename is determined
                    by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-STAMP'><filename>STAMP</filename></ulink>
                    variable, and the end of the name consists of the task's
                    name and current
                    <link linkend='overview-checksums'>input checksum</link>.
                    <note>
                        This naming scheme assumes that
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER'><filename>BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER</filename></ulink>
                        is "OEBasicHash", which is almost always the case in
                        current OpenEmbedded.
                    </note>
                    To determine if a task needs to be rerun, BitBake checks
                    if a stamp file with a matching input checksum exists
                    for the task.
                    If such a stamp file exists, the task's output is
                    assumed to exist and still be valid.
                    If the file does not exist, the task is rerun.
                    <note>
                        <para>The stamp mechanism is more general than the
                        shared state (sstate) cache mechanism described in the
                        "<link linkend='setscene-tasks-and-shared-state'>Setscene Tasks and Shared State</link>"
                        section.
                        BitBake avoids rerunning any task that has a valid
                        stamp file, not just tasks that can be accelerated
                        through the sstate cache.</para>

                        <para>However, you should realize that stamp files only
                        serve as a marker that some work has been done and that
                        these files do not record task output.
                        The actual task output would usually be somewhere in
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TMPDIR'><filename>TMPDIR</filename></ulink>
                        (e.g. in some recipe's
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.)
                        What the sstate cache mechanism adds is a way to cache
                        task output that can then be shared between build
                        machines.</para>
                    </note>
                    Since <filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename> is usually a
                    subdirectory of <filename>TMPDIR</filename>, removing
                    <filename>TMPDIR</filename> will also remove
                    <filename>STAMPS_DIR</filename>, which means tasks will
                    properly be rerun to repopulate
                    <filename>TMPDIR</filename>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you want some task to always be considered "out of
                    date", you can mark it with the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#variable-flags'><filename>nostamp</filename></ulink>
                    varflag.
                    If some other task depends on such a task, then that
                    task will also always be considered out of date, which
                    might not be what you want.

                    The description of tasks so far assumes that BitBake needs
                    to build everything and there are no prebuilt objects
                    available.
                    BitBake does support skipping tasks if prebuilt objects are
                    available.
                    These objects are usually made available in the form of a
                    shared state (sstate) cache.

                        For information on variables affecting sstate, see the

                <para>
                    The idea of a setscene task (i.e
                    <filename>do_</filename><replaceable>taskname</replaceable><filename>_setscene</filename>)
                    is a version of the task where
                    instead of building something, BitBake can skip to the end
                    result and simply place a set of files into specific
                    locations as needed.
                    In some cases, it makes sense to have a setscene task
                    variant (e.g. generating package files in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package_write_deb'><filename>do_package_write_*</filename></ulink>
                    task).
                    In other cases, it does not make sense, (e.g. a
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-patch'><filename>do_patch</filename></ulink>
                    task or
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-unpack'><filename>do_unpack</filename></ulink>
                    task) since the work involved would be equal to or greater
                    than the underlying task.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In the OpenEmbedded build system, the common tasks that
                    have setscene variants are
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>,
                    <filename>do_package_write_*</filename>,
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-deploy'><filename>do_deploy</filename></ulink>,
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-packagedata'><filename>do_packagedata</filename></ulink>,
                    and
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-populate_sysroot'><filename>do_populate_sysroot</filename></ulink>.
                    Notice that these are most of the tasks whose output is an
                    end result.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The OpenEmbedded build system has knowledge of the
                    relationship between these tasks and other tasks that
                    precede them.
                    For example, if BitBake runs
                    <filename>do_populate_sysroot_setscene</filename> for
                    something, there is little point in running any of the
                    <filename>do_fetch</filename>,
                    <filename>do_unpack</filename>,
                    <filename>do_patch</filename>,
                    <filename>do_configure</filename>,
                    <filename>do_compile</filename>, and
                    <filename>do_install</filename> tasks.
                    However, if <filename>do_package</filename> needs to be
                    run, BitBake would need to run those other tasks.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It becomes more complicated if everything can come
                    from an sstate cache because some objects are simply
                    not required at all.
                    For example, you do not need a compiler or native tools,
                    such as quilt, if there is nothing to compile or patch.
                    If the <filename>do_package_write_*</filename> packages
                    are available from sstate, BitBake does not need the
                    <filename>do_package</filename> task data.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To handle all these complexities, BitBake runs in two
                    phases.
                    The first is the "setscene" stage.
                    During this stage, BitBake first checks the sstate cache
                    for any targets it is planning to build.
                    BitBake does a fast check to see if the object exists
                    rather than a complete download.
                    If nothing exists, the second phase, which is the setscene
                    stage, completes and the main build proceeds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If objects are found in the sstate cache, the OpenEmbedded
                    build system works backwards from the end targets specified
                    by the user.
                    For example, if an image is being built, the OpenEmbedded
                    build system first looks for the packages needed for
                    that image and the tools needed to construct an image.
                    If those are available, the compiler is not needed.
                    Thus, the compiler is not even downloaded.
                    If something was found to be unavailable, or the
                    download or setscene task fails, the OpenEmbedded build
                    system then tries to install dependencies, such as the
                    compiler, from the cache.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The availability of objects in the sstate cache is
                    handled by the function specified by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION'><filename>BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION</filename></ulink>
                    variable and returns a list of the objects that are
                    available.
                    The function specified by the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BB_URL;#var-BB_SETSCENE_DEPVALID'><filename>BB_SETSCENE_DEPVALID</filename></ulink>
                    variable is the function that determines whether a given
                    dependency needs to be followed, and whether for any given
                    relationship the function needs to be passed.
                    The function returns a True or False value.

                the output labeled "Application Development SDK" represents an
                SDK.
                The SDK generation process differs depending on whether you
                build a standard SDK (e.g.
                <filename>bitbake -c populate_sdk</filename> <replaceable>imagename</replaceable>)
                or an extensible SDK (e.g.
                <filename>bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext</filename> <replaceable>imagename</replaceable>).
                This section is going to take a closer look at this output:

            <para>
                The specific form of this output is a self-extracting
                SDK installer (<filename>*.sh</filename>) that, when run,
                installs the SDK, which consists of a cross-development
                toolchain, a set of libraries and headers, and an SDK
                environment setup script.
                Running this installer essentially sets up your
                cross-development environment.
                You can think of the cross-toolchain as the "host"
                part because it runs on the SDK machine.
                You can think of the libraries and headers as the "target"
                part because they are built for the target hardware.
                The environment setup script is added so that you can
                initialize the environment before using the tools.

            This section provides some technical background on how

            In the Yocto Project development environment, cross-development
            toolchains are used to build the image and applications that run
            on the target hardware.
            With just a few commands, the OpenEmbedded build system creates
            these necessary toolchains for you.

            Most of the work occurs on the Build Host.
            This is the machine used to build images and generally work within
            the the Yocto Project environment.
            When you run
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            to create an image, the OpenEmbedded build system
            uses the host <filename>gcc</filename> compiler to bootstrap a
            cross-compiler named <filename>gcc-cross</filename>.
            The <filename>gcc-cross</filename> compiler is what BitBake uses to
            compile source files when creating the target image.
            You can think of <filename>gcc-cross</filename> simply as an
            automatically generated cross-compiler that is used internally
            within BitBake only.
            <note>
                The extensible SDK does not use
                <filename>gcc-cross-canadian</filename> since this SDK
                ships a copy of the OpenEmbedded build system and the sysroot

            You can use the OpenEmbedded build system to build an installer for
            the relocatable SDK used to develop applications.
            When you run the installer, it installs the toolchain, which
            contains the development tools (e.g.,
            <filename>gcc-cross-canadian</filename>,
            <filename>binutils-cross-canadian</filename>, and other
            <filename>nativesdk-*</filename> tools),

            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SDK_ARCH'><filename>SDK_ARCH</filename></ulink>),
            you need to cross-compile and test your software.
            The figure shows the commands you use to easily build out this
            toolchain.
            This cross-development toolchain is built to execute on the

                If your target architecture is supported by the Yocto Project,

            By design, the OpenEmbedded build system builds everything from
            scratch unless
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            can determine that parts do not need to be rebuilt.
            Fundamentally, building from scratch is attractive as it means all
            parts are built fresh and there is no possibility of stale data
            causing problems.
            When developers hit problems, they typically default back to
            building from scratch so they know the state of things from the
            start.
        </para>

        <para>
            Building an image from scratch is both an advantage and a
            disadvantage to the process.
            As mentioned in the previous paragraph, building from scratch
            ensures that everything is current and starts from a known state.
            However, building from scratch also takes much longer as it
            generally means rebuilding things that do not necessarily need
            to be rebuilt.

            The Yocto Project implements shared state code that supports
            incremental builds.
            The implementation of the shared state code answers the following
            questions that were fundamental roadblocks within the OpenEmbedded
            incremental build support system:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>
                    What pieces of the system have changed and what pieces have

                    How are pre-built components that do not need to be rebuilt

                    </para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            For the first question, the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
            detects changes in the "inputs" to a given task by creating a
            checksum (or signature) of the task's inputs.
            If the checksum changes, the system assumes the inputs have changed
            and the task needs to be rerun.
            For the second question, the shared state (sstate) code tracks
            which tasks add which output to the build process.
            This means the output from a given task can be removed, upgraded
            or otherwise manipulated.
            The third question is partly addressed by the solution for the
            second question assuming the build system can fetch the sstate
            objects from remote locations and install them if they are deemed
            to be valid.
            <note>
                The OpenEmbedded build system does not maintain
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>
                information as part of the shared state packages.
                Consequently, considerations exist that affect maintaining
                shared state feeds.
                For information on how the OpenEmbedded build system

            <title>Overall Architecture</title>

            <para>
                When determining what parts of the system need to be built,
                BitBake works on a per-task basis rather than a per-recipe
                basis.
                You might wonder why using a per-task basis is preferred over
                a per-recipe basis.
                To help explain, consider having the IPK packaging backend
                enabled and then switching to DEB.
                In this case, the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                and
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>
                task outputs are still valid.
                However, with a per-recipe approach, the build would not
                include the <filename>.deb</filename> files.
                Consequently, you would have to invalidate the whole build and
                rerun it.
                Rerunning everything is not the best solution.
                Also, in this case, the core must be "taught" much about
                specific tasks.
                This methodology does not scale well and does not allow users
                to easily add new tasks in layers or as external recipes
                without touching the packaged-staging core.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='overview-checksums'>
            <title>Checksums (Signatures)</title>

            <para>
                The shared state code uses a checksum, which is a unique
                signature of a task's inputs, to determine if a task needs to
                be run again.
                Because it is a change in a task's inputs that triggers a
                rerun, the process needs to detect all the inputs to a given
                task.
                For shell tasks, this turns out to be fairly easy because
                the build process generates a "run" shell script for each task
                and it is possible to create a checksum that gives you a good
                idea of when the task's data changes.
            </para>

            <para>
                To complicate the problem, there are things that should not be
                included in the checksum.
                First, there is the actual specific build path of a given
                task - the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.
                It does not matter if the work directory changes because it
                should not affect the output for target packages.
                Also, the build process has the objective of making native
                or cross packages relocatable.
                <note>
                    Both native and cross packages run on the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#hardware-build-system-term'>build host</ulink>.
                    However, cross packages generate output for the target
                    architecture.
                </note>
                The checksum therefore needs to exclude
                <filename>WORKDIR</filename>.
                The simplistic approach for excluding the work directory is to
                set <filename>WORKDIR</filename> to some fixed value and
                create the checksum for the "run" script.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another problem results from the "run" scripts containing
                functions that might or might not get called.
                The incremental build solution contains code that figures out
                dependencies between shell functions.
                This code is used to prune the "run" scripts down to the
                minimum set, thereby alleviating this problem and making the
                "run" scripts much more readable as a bonus.
            </para>

            <para>
                So far, solutions for shell scripts exist.
                What about Python tasks?
                The same approach applies even though these tasks are more
                difficult.
                The process needs to figure out what variables a Python
                function accesses and what functions it calls.
                Again, the incremental build solution contains code that first
                figures out the variable and function dependencies, and then
                creates a checksum for the data used as the input to the task.
            </para>

            <para>
                Like the <filename>WORKDIR</filename> case, situations exist
                where dependencies should be ignored.
                For these situations, you can instruct the build process to
                ignore a dependency by using a line like the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardepsexclude] = "MACHINE"
                </literallayout>
                This example ensures that the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PACKAGE_ARCHS'><filename>PACKAGE_ARCHS</filename></ulink>
                variable does not depend on the value of
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-MACHINE'><filename>MACHINE</filename></ulink>,
                even if it does reference it.
            </para>

            <para>
                Equally, there are cases where you need to add dependencies
                BitBake is not able to find.
                You can accomplish this by using a line like the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
      PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardeps] = "MACHINE"
                </literallayout>
                This example explicitly adds the <filename>MACHINE</filename>
                variable as a dependency for
                <filename>PACKAGE_ARCHS</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                As an example, consider a case with in-line Python where
                BitBake is not able to figure out dependencies.
                When running in debug mode (i.e. using
                <filename>-DDD</filename>), BitBake produces output when it
                discovers something for which it cannot figure out dependencies.
                The Yocto Project team has currently not managed to cover
                those dependencies in detail and is aware of the need to fix
                this situation.
            </para>

            <para>
                Thus far, this section has limited discussion to the direct
                inputs into a task.
                Information based on direct inputs is referred to as the
                "basehash" in the code.
                However, there is still the question of a task's indirect
                inputs - the things that were already built and present in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>.
                The checksum (or signature) for a particular task needs to add
                the hashes of all the tasks on which the particular task
                depends.
                Choosing which dependencies to add is a policy decision.
                However, the effect is to generate a master checksum that
                combines the basehash and the hashes of the task's
                dependencies.
            </para>

            <para>
                At the code level, a variety of ways exist by which both the
                basehash and the dependent task hashes can be influenced.
                Within the BitBake configuration file, you can give BitBake
                some extra information to help it construct the basehash.
                The following statement effectively results in a list of
                global variable dependency excludes - variables never
                included in any checksum:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST ?= "TMPDIR FILE PATH PWD BB_TASKHASH BBPATH DL_DIR \
         SSTATE_DIR THISDIR FILESEXTRAPATHS FILE_DIRNAME HOME LOGNAME SHELL TERM \
         USER FILESPATH STAGING_DIR_HOST STAGING_DIR_TARGET COREBASE PRSERV_HOST \
         PRSERV_DUMPDIR PRSERV_DUMPFILE PRSERV_LOCKDOWN PARALLEL_MAKE \
         CCACHE_DIR EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN CCACHE CCACHE_DISABLE LICENSE_PATH SDKPKGSUFFIX"
                </literallayout>
                The previous example excludes
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>
                since that variable is actually constructed as a path within
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-TMPDIR'><filename>TMPDIR</filename></ulink>,
                which is on the whitelist.
            </para>

            <para>
                The rules for deciding which hashes of dependent tasks to
                include through dependency chains are more complex and are
                generally accomplished with a Python function.
                The code in <filename>meta/lib/oe/sstatesig.py</filename> shows
                two examples of this and also illustrates how you can insert
                your own policy into the system if so desired.
                This file defines the two basic signature generators
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#oe-core'>OE-Core</ulink>
                uses:  "OEBasic" and "OEBasicHash".
                By default, there is a dummy "noop" signature handler enabled
                in BitBake.
                This means that behavior is unchanged from previous versions.
                OE-Core uses the "OEBasicHash" signature handler by default
                through this setting in the <filename>bitbake.conf</filename>
                file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER ?= "OEBasicHash"
                </literallayout>
                The "OEBasicHash" <filename>BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER</filename>
                is the same as the "OEBasic" version but adds the task hash to
                the stamp files.
                This results in any
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>
                change that changes the task hash, automatically
                causing the task to be run again.
                This removes the need to bump
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-PR'><filename>PR</filename></ulink>
                values, and changes to Metadata automatically ripple across
                the build.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is also worth noting that the end result of these
                signature generators is to make some dependency and hash
                information available to the build.
                This information includes:

            <title>Shared State</title>

            <para>
                Checksums and dependencies, as discussed in the previous
                section, solve half the problem of supporting a shared state.
                The other part of the problem is being able to use checksum
                information during the build and being able to reuse or rebuild
                specific components.
            </para>

            <para>
                The
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-classes-sstate'><filename>sstate</filename></ulink>
                class is a relatively generic implementation of how to
                "capture" a snapshot of a given task.
                The idea is that the build process does not care about the
                source of a task's output.
                Output could be freshly built or it could be downloaded and
                unpacked from somewhere - the build process does not need to
                worry about its origin.
            </para>

            <para>
                Two types of output exist.
                One type is just about creating a directory in
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink>.
                A good example is the output of either
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>
                or
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>.
                The other type of output occurs when a set of data is merged
                into a shared directory tree such as the sysroot.

                The Yocto Project team has tried to keep the details of the

                From a user's perspective, adding shared state wrapping to a task
                is as simple as this

                example taken from the

                The shared state package validity can be detected just by
                looking at the filename since the filename contains the task
                checksum (or signature) as described earlier in this section.
                If a valid shared state package is found, the build process
                downloads it and uses it to accelerate the task.

            <para>
                The build processes use the <filename>*_setscene</filename>
                tasks for the task acceleration phase.
                BitBake goes through this phase before the main execution
                code and tries to accelerate any tasks for which it can find
                shared state packages.
                If a shared state package for a task is available, the
                shared state package is used.
                This means the task and any tasks on which it is dependent
                are not executed.

                Since the sysroot is not used, it would never get extracted.
                This is another reason why a task-based approach is preferred
                over a recipe-based approach, which would have to install the

                <title>Invalidating Shared State</title>

                <para>
                    The OpenEmbedded build system uses checksums and shared
                    state cache to avoid unnecessarily rebuilding tasks.
                    Collectively, this scheme is known as "shared state code."
                </para>

                <para>
                    As with all schemes, this one has some drawbacks.
                    It is possible that you could make implicit changes to your
                    code that the checksum calculations do not take into
                    account.
                    These implicit changes affect a task's output but do not
                    trigger the shared state code into rebuilding a recipe.
                    Consider an example during which a tool changes its output.
                    Assume that the output of <filename>rpmdeps</filename>
                    changes.
                    The result of the change should be that all the
                    <filename>package</filename> and
                    <filename>package_write_rpm</filename> shared state cache
                    items become invalid.
                    However, because the change to the output is
                    external to the code and therefore implicit,
                    the associated shared state cache items do not become
                    invalidated.
                    In this case, the build process uses the cached items
                    rather than running the task again.
                    Obviously, these types of implicit changes can cause
                    problems.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To avoid these problems during the build, you need to
                    understand the effects of any changes you make.
                    Realize that changes you make directly to a function
                    are automatically factored into the checksum calculation.
                    Thus, these explicit changes invalidate the associated
                    area of shared state cache.
                    However, you need to be aware of any implicit changes that
                    are not obvious changes to the code and could affect
                    the output of a given task.
                </para>

                <para>
                    When you identify an implicit change, you can easily
                    take steps to invalidate the cache and force the tasks
                    to run.
                    The steps you can take are as simple as changing a
                    function's comments in the source code.
                    For example, to invalidate package shared state files,
                    change the comment statements of
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package'><filename>do_package</filename></ulink>
                    or the comments of one of the functions it calls.
                    Even though the change is purely cosmetic, it causes the
                    checksum to be recalculated and forces the OpenEmbedded
                    build system to run the task again.
                    <note>
                        For an example of a commit that makes a cosmetic
                        change to invalidate shared state, see this

        <para>
            The OpenEmbedded build system automatically adds common types of
            runtime dependencies between packages, which means that you do not
            need to explicitly declare the packages using
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-RDEPENDS'><filename>RDEPENDS</filename></ulink>.
            Three automatic mechanisms exist (<filename>shlibdeps</filename>,
            <filename>pcdeps</filename>, and <filename>depchains</filename>)
            that handle shared libraries, package configuration (pkg-config)
            modules, and <filename>-dev</filename> and
            <filename>-dbg</filename> packages, respectively.
            For other types of runtime dependencies, you must manually declare
            the dependencies.

                    recipe are located.
                    For each shared library, the package that contains the
                    shared library is registered as providing the shared
                    library.
                    More specifically, the package is registered as providing
                    the
                    <ulink url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname'>soname</ulink>

                    installed by the recipe are inspected to see what shared
                    libraries they link against.
                    For each shared library dependency that is found,
                    <filename>PKGDATA_DIR</filename> is queried to
                    see if some package (likely from a different recipe)
                    contains the shared library.
                    If such a package is found, a runtime dependency is added
                    from the package that depends on the shared library to the
                    package that contains the library.</para>

                    had been added to <filename>RDEPENDS</filename>.
                    This forces an upgrade of the package containing the shared

        <para>
            Some tasks are easier to implement when allowed to perform certain
            operations that are normally reserved for the root user (e.g.
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-install'><filename>do_install</filename></ulink>,
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-package_write_deb'><filename>do_package_write*</filename></ulink>,
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-rootfs'><filename>do_rootfs</filename></ulink>,
            and
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-tasks-image'><filename>do_image*</filename></ulink>).
            For example, the <filename>do_install</filename> task benefits
            from being able to set the UID and GID of installed files to
            arbitrary values.
        </para>

        <para>
            One approach to allowing tasks to perform root-only operations
            would be to require
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#bitbake-term'>BitBake</ulink>
            to run as root.
            However, this method is cumbersome and has security issues.
            The approach that is actually used is to run tasks that benefit
            from root privileges in a "fake" root environment.
            Within this environment, the task and its child processes believe
            that they are running as the root user, and see an internally
            consistent view of the filesystem.
            As long as generating the final output (e.g. a package or an image)
            does not require root privileges, the fact that some earlier
            steps ran in a fake root environment does not cause problems.
        </para>

        <para>
            The capability to run tasks in a fake root environment is known as
            "<ulink url='http://man.he.net/man1/fakeroot'>fakeroot</ulink>",
            which is derived from the BitBake keyword/variable
            flag that requests a fake root environment for a task.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>,
            the program that implements fakeroot is known as Pseudo.
            Pseudo overrides system calls by using the environment variable
            <filename>LD_PRELOAD</filename>, which results in the illusion
            of running as root.
            To keep track of "fake" file ownership and permissions resulting
            from operations that require root permissions, Pseudo uses
            an SQLite 3 database.
            This database is stored in
            <filename>${</filename><ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-WORKDIR'><filename>WORKDIR</filename></ulink><filename>}/pseudo/files.db</filename>
            for individual recipes.
            Storing the database in a file as opposed to in memory
            gives persistence between tasks and builds, which is not
            accomplished using fakeroot.
            <note><title>Caution</title>
                If you add your own task that manipulates the same files or
                directories as a fakeroot task, then that task also needs to
                run under fakeroot.
                Otherwise, the task cannot run root-only operations, and
                cannot see the fake file ownership and permissions set by the
                other task.
                You need to also add a dependency on
                <filename>virtual/fakeroot-native:do_populate_sysroot</filename>,
                giving the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
       fakeroot do_mytask () {
           ...

            is a computer display server protocol that
            provides a method for compositing window managers to communicate
            directly with applications and video hardware and expects them to
            communicate with input hardware using other libraries.
            Using Wayland with supporting targets can result in better control
            over graphics frame rendering than an application might otherwise
            achieve.

                Specifically, you can find the recipes that build both Wayland

            <para>
                You can build both the Wayland and Weston packages for use only

                which is also known as Mesa DRI.
                This implies that you cannot build and use the packages if your

                <note>
                    Due to lack of EGL support, Weston 1.0.3 will not run
                    directly on the emulated QEMU hardware.

                <title>Explanation of Syntax</title>

                <para>
                    As mentioned in the previous section, the
                    <filename>LIC_FILES_CHKSUM</filename> variable lists all
                    the important files that contain the license text for the
                    source code.
                    It is possible to specify a checksum for an entire file,
                    or a specific section of a file (specified by beginning and
                    ending line numbers with the "beginline" and "endline"
                    parameters, respectively).
                    The latter is useful for source files with a license
                    notice header, README documents, and so forth.
                    If you do not use the "beginline" parameter, then it is
                    assumed that the text begins on the first line of the file.
                    Similarly, if you do not use the "endline" parameter,
                    it is assumed that the license text ends with the last
                    line of the file.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The "md5" parameter stores the md5 checksum of the license
                    text.
                    If the license text changes in any way as compared to
                    this parameter then a mismatch occurs.
                    This mismatch triggers a build failure and notifies
                    the developer.
                    Notification allows the developer to review and address
                    the license text changes.
                    Also note that if a mismatch occurs during the build,
                    the correct md5 checksum is placed in the build log and
                    can be easily copied to the recipe.

                    There is no limit to how many files you can specify using
                    the <filename>LIC_FILES_CHKSUM</filename> variable.
                    Generally, however, every project requires a few
                    specifications for license tracking.
                    Many projects have a "COPYING" file that stores the
                    license information for all the source code files.
                    This practice allows you to just track the "COPYING"
                    file as long as it is kept up to date.

            <title>Enabling Commercially Licensed Recipes</title>

            <para>
                By default, the OpenEmbedded build system disables
                components that have commercial or other special licensing
                requirements.
                Such requirements are defined on a
                recipe-by-recipe basis through the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE_FLAGS'><filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename></ulink>
                variable definition in the affected recipe.
                For instance, the
                <filename>poky/meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/gst-plugins-ugly</filename>
                recipe contains the following statement:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"
                </literallayout>
                Here is a slightly more complicated example that contains both
                an explicit recipe name and version (after variable expansion):
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "license_${PN}_${PV}"
                </literallayout>
	            In order for a component restricted by a
                <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> definition to be enabled and
                included in an image, it needs to have a matching entry in the
                global
	            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST'><filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename></ulink>
                variable, which is a variable typically defined in your
                <filename>local.conf</filename> file.
                For example, to enable the
                <filename>poky/meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/gst-plugins-ugly</filename>
	            package, you could add either the string
	            "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly" or the more general string
	            "commercial" to <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename>.
                See the
                "<link linkend='license-flag-matching'>License Flag Matching</link>"
                section for a full
                explanation of how <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> matching
                works.
                Here is the example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly"
                </literallayout>
	            Likewise, to additionally enable the package built from the
                recipe containing
	            <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS = "license_${PN}_${PV}"</filename>,
                and assuming that the actual recipe name was
                <filename>emgd_1.10.bb</filename>, the following string would
                enable that package as well as the original
                <filename>gst-plugins-ugly</filename> package:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly license_emgd_1.10"
                </literallayout>
	            As a convenience, you do not need to specify the complete
                license string in the whitelist for every package.
                You can use an abbreviated form, which consists
                of just the first portion or portions of the license
                string before the initial underscore character or characters.
                A partial string will match any license that contains the
                given string as the first portion of its license.
                For example, the following whitelist string will also match
                both of the packages previously mentioned as well as any other
                packages that have licenses starting with "commercial" or
                "license".
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial license"
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <section id="license-flag-matching">
                <title>License Flag Matching</title>

                <para>
		            License flag matching allows you to control what recipes
                    the OpenEmbedded build system includes in the build.
                    Fundamentally, the build system attempts to match
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> strings found in recipes
                    against <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename>
                    strings found in the whitelist.
                    A match causes the build system to include a recipe in the
                    build, while failure to find a match causes the build
                    system to exclude a recipe.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In general, license flag matching is simple.
                    However, understanding some concepts will help you
                    correctly and effectively use matching.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Before a flag
                    defined by a particular recipe is tested against the
                    contents of the whitelist, the expanded string
                    <filename>_${PN}</filename> is appended to the flag.
                    This expansion makes each
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> value recipe-specific.
                    After expansion, the string is then matched against the
                    whitelist.
                    Thus, specifying
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"</filename>
                    in recipe "foo", for example, results in the string
                    <filename>"commercial_foo"</filename>.
                    And, to create a match, that string must appear in the
                    whitelist.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Judicious use of the <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename>
                    strings and the contents of the
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename> variable
                    allows you a lot of flexibility for including or excluding
                    recipes based on licensing.
                    For example, you can broaden the matching capabilities by
                    using license flags string subsets in the whitelist.
                    <note>
                        When using a string subset, be sure to use the part of
                        the expanded string that precedes the appended
                        underscore character (e.g.
                        <filename>usethispart_1.3</filename>,
                        <filename>usethispart_1.4</filename>, and so forth).
                    </note>
                    For example, simply specifying the string "commercial" in
                    the whitelist matches any expanded
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> definition that starts
                    with the string "commercial" such as "commercial_foo" and
                    "commercial_bar", which are the strings the build system
                    automatically generates for hypothetical recipes named
                    "foo" and "bar" assuming those recipes simply specify the
                    following:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"
                    </literallayout>
                    Thus, you can choose to exhaustively
                    enumerate each license flag in the whitelist and
                    allow only specific recipes into the image, or
                    you can use a string subset that causes a broader range of
                    matches to allow a range of recipes into the image.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This scheme works even if the
                    <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename> string already
                    has <filename>_${PN}</filename> appended.
                    For example, the build system turns the license flag
                    "commercial_1.2_foo" into "commercial_1.2_foo_foo" and
                    would match both the general "commercial" and the specific
                    "commercial_1.2_foo" strings found in the whitelist, as
                    expected.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Here are some other scenarios:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para>
                            You can specify a versioned string in the recipe
                            such as "commercial_foo_1.2" in a "foo" recipe.
                            The build system expands this string to
                            "commercial_foo_1.2_foo".
                            Combine this license flag with a whitelist that has
                            the string "commercial" and you match the flag
                            along with any other flag that starts with the
                            string "commercial".

                            "commercial_foo" in the whitelist and the build
                            system not only matches "commercial_foo_1.2" but
                            also matches any license flag with the string
                            "commercial_foo", regardless of the version.

                            "commercial_foo_1.2") to specifically match a

                    </literallayout>
                    If you want to enable these components, you can do so by
                    making sure you have statements similar to the following

                    Of course, you could also create a matching whitelist
                    for those components using the more general "commercial"
                    in the whitelist, but that would also enable all the
