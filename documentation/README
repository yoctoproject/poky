documentation
=============

This is the directory that contains the Yocto Project documentation.  The Yocto
Project source repositories at http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi have two 
instances of the "documentation" directory.  You should understand each of
these instances.

  poky/documentation - The directory within the poky Git repository containing
                       the set of Yocto Project manuals.  When you clone the 
                       poky Git repository, the documentation directory 
                       contains the manuals.  The state of the manuals in this 
                       directory is guaranteed to reflect the latest Yocto 
                       Project release.  The manuals at the tip of this 
                       directory will also likely contain most manual 
                       development changes.

  yocto-docs/documentation - The Git repository for the Yocto Project manuals.  
                             This repository is where manual development 
                             occurs.  If you plan on contributing back to the 
                             Yocto Project documentation, you should set up 
                             a local Git repository based on this upstream 
                             repository as follows:

                               git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-docs

                             Changes and patches are first pushed to the 
                             yocto-docs Git repository.  Later, they make it 
                             into the poky Git repository found at 
                             git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.  

Manual Organization
===================

Folders exist for individual manuals as follows:

* adt-manual       - The Yocto Project Application Development Toolkit (ADT)
                     User's Guide.
* bsp-guide        - The Yocto Project Board Support (BSP) Developer's Guide
* dev-manual       - The Yocto Project Development Manual
* kernel-manual    - The Yocto Project Kernel Architecture and Use Manual
* poky-ref-manual  - The Yocto Project Reference Manual
* yocto-project-qs - The Yocto Project Quick Start

Each folder is self-contained regarding content and figures. 

Makefile
========

The Makefile processes manual directories to create HTML, PDF,
tarballs, etc.  Details on how the Makefile work are documented
inside the Makefile.  See that file for more information.

To build a manual, you run the make command and pass it the name
of the folder containing the manual's contents. 
For example, the following command run from the documentation directory 
creates an HTML and a PDF version of the ADT manual.
The DOC variable specifies the manual you are making:

     $ make DOC=adt-manual

poky.ent
========

This file defines variables used for documentation production.  The variables
are used to define release pathnames, URLs for the published manuals, etc.

template
========
Contains various templates, fonts, and some old PNG files.

tools
=====
Contains a tool to convert the DocBook files to PDF format.
