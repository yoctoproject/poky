    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
        Regardless of how you intend to make use of the Yocto Project,
        chances are you will work with the Linux kernel.
        This manual introduces the kernel development process and
        provides background information on the Yocto Linux kernel
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>,
        describes common tasks you can perform using the kernel tools,
        and shows you how to use the kernel Metadata needed to work with
        the kernel inside the Yocto Project.
   </para>

   <para>
        Each Yocto Project release has a set of Yocto Linux kernel recipes,
        whose Git repositories you can view in the Yocto
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;'>Source Repositories</ulink> under
        the "Yocto Linux Kernel" heading.
        New recipes for the release track the latest Linux kernel
        upstream developments from
        <ulink url='http://www.kernel.org'></ulink> and introduce
        newly-supported platforms.
        Previous recipes in the release are refreshed and supported for at
        least one additional Yocto Project release.
        As they align, these previous releases are updated to include the
        latest from the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;/organization/long-term-support-initiative-ltsi'>Long Term Support Initiative</ulink>
        (LTSI) project.
        Also included is a Yocto Linux kernel development recipe
        (<filename>linux-yocto-dev.bb</filename>) should you want to work
        with the very latest in upstream Yocto Linux kernel development and
        kernel Metadata development.
        <note>
            For more on Yocto Linux kernels, see the
            "<link linkend='kernel-big-picture'>Yocto Project Kernel Development and Maintenance</link>
            section.
        </note>
    </para>

    <para>
        The Yocto Project also provides a powerful set of kernel
        tools for managing Yocto Linux kernel sources and configuration data.
        You can use these tools to make a single configuration change,
        apply multiple patches, or work with your own kernel sources.
    </para>

    <para>
        In particular, the kernel tools allow you to generate configuration
        fragments that specify only what you must, and nothing more.
        Configuration fragments only need to contain the highest level
        visible <filename>CONFIG</filename> options as presented by the
        Yocto Linux kernel <filename>menuconfig</filename> system.
        Contrast this against a complete Yocto Linux kernel
        <filename>.config</filename> file, which includes all the automatically
        selected <filename>CONFIG</filename> options.
        This efficiency reduces your maintenance effort and allows you
        to further separate your configuration in ways that make sense for
        your project.
        A common split separates policy and hardware.
        For example, all your kernels might support the
        <filename>proc</filename> and <filename>sys</filename> filesystems,
        but only specific boards require sound, USB, or specific drivers.
        Specifying these configurations individually allows you to aggregate
        them together as needed, but maintains them in only one place.
        Similar logic applies to separating source changes.
    </para>

    <para>
        If you do not maintain your own kernel sources and need to make
        only minimal changes to the sources, the released recipes provide a
        vetted base upon which to layer your changes.
        Doing so allows you to benefit from the continual kernel
        integration and testing performed during development of the
        Yocto Project.
    </para>

    <para>
        If, instead, you have a very specific Linux kernel source tree
        and are unable to align with one of the official Yocto Linux kernel
        recipes, an alternative exists by which you can use the Yocto
        Project Linux kernel tools with your own kernel sources.

        <title>Getting Ready for Traditional Kernel Development</title>

        <para>
            For traditional kernel development using the Yocto
            Project, you need to establish local copies of the
            kernel source.
            You can find Git repositories of supported Yocto Project
            kernels organized under "Yocto Linux Kernel" in the Yocto
            Project Source Repositories at
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;/cgit.cgi'></ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            This setup can involve creating a bare clone of the
            Yocto Project kernel and then copying that cloned
            repository.
            You can create the bare clone and the copy of the bare
            clone anywhere you like.
            For simplicity, it is recommended that you create these
            structures outside of the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;source-directory'>Source Directory</ulink>,
            which is usually named <filename>poky</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The following steps show how to create a bare clone of the
            <filename>linux-yocto-4.4</filename> kernel and then
            create a copy of that clone:
            <note>
                When you have a local Yocto Project kernel Git
                repository, you can reference that repository rather than
                the upstream Git repository as part of the
                <filename>clone</filename> command.
                Doing so can speed up the process.

                    In particular, it contains the kernel BitBake append
                    (<filename>.bbappend</filename>) files that you edit to
                    point to your locally modified kernel source files and
                    to build the kernel image.
                    Pointing to these local files is much more efficient
                    than requiring a download of the kernel's source files
                    from upstream each time you make changes to the kernel.

    <title>Kernel Modification Workflow</title>

    <para>
        Kernel modification involves changing the Yocto Project kernel,
        which could involve changing configuration options as well as adding
        new kernel recipes.
        Configuration changes can be added in the form of configuration
        fragments, while recipe modification comes through the kernel's
        <filename>recipes-kernel</filename> area in a kernel layer you create.

        Finally, while this document focuses on the manual creation of
        recipes, patches, and configuration files, the Yocto Project
        Board Support Package (BSP) tools are available to automate
        this process with existing content and work well to create the
        initial framework and boilerplate code.
        For details on these tools, see the
        "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_BSP_URL;#using-the-yocto-projects-bsp-tools'>Using the Yocto Project's BSP Tools</ulink>"
        section in the Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's
        Guide.
