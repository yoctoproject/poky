**************************************************
Yocto Project Supported Architectures And Features
**************************************************

The Yocto Project is putting continuous efforts into testing the changes made to
the :term:`OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core)` metadata and core tools. The details on
how this test environment functions is described in the
:doc:`/test-manual/index`.

These tests are also run for stable and :term:`LTS` versions of the Yocto
Project. See the :doc:`/ref-manual/release-process` section of the Yocto Project
Reference Manual for more information on these types of releases.

The infrastructure behind the test environment is the
:ref:`Yocto Project Autobuilder <test-manual/intro:Yocto Project Autobuilder
Overview>`. The Autobuilder contains a set of Builders that are associated to an
architecture or a feature to test. For example, the ``qemuarm64`` builder
corresponds to testing the ARM 64-bit architecture.

Below is a comprehensive list of target architectures and features that are
supported, as well as their level of support. For each architecture or feature,
their corresponding builders are also listed.

Primary Supported
=================

The term "primary" means that dedicated builds for these architectures or
features are being run on a daily basis on the Yocto Project Autobuilder and
also tested with incoming changes before they merge. These changes are usually
on the "-next" Git branches of the :term:`OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core)`
repositories.

Below is a list of primary tested features, their maintainer(s) and builder(s):

Secondary Supported
===================

The term "secondary" means that in some cases there is code/feature/support
which is desired by people using the project and is in the project's interests
to support, however there isn't wide enough interest and support to justify
testing all incoming changes on it. There are however project member
organisations and maintainers willing to run tests and review fixes.

This category may be applicable as support/usage in an area develops and grows,
or as support/usage fades but we continue to have tests. It can also apply where
resourcing isn't available for full primary support but there is
member/maintainer support for running tests.

We therefore have the following criteria and policies for such items:

-  It can be clearly isolated and defined by specific configuration.

-  There is a clear documented group of maintainers agreeing to maintain it.

-  Those maintainers are active and responsive.

-  It is being actively and publicly tested (potentially using
   the :ref:`Autobuilder <test-manual/intro:Yocto Project Autobuilder Overview>`
   by agreement, or otherwise).

-  Testing would not be part of standard incoming change testing and regressions
   would not block incoming patches.

-  The :yocto_wiki:`SWAT </Yocto_Build_Failure_Swat_Team>` team would not handle
   any test builds on the Autobuilder.

-  Test results can be submitted as part of the release process if desired.

The Yocto Project :oe_wiki:`Technical Steering Committee (TSC) </TSC>` makes
decisions on features in this status and Autobuilder testing. Such support would
be dropped if the maintainers/testing were inactive.

If you are interested in providing resources for improving testing please
contact the :oe_wiki:`Technical Steering Committee (TSC) </TSC>`.

Untested
========

"Untested" means that whilst the configurations are present in the project, we
don't currently run the tests on any regular basis and new changes are not
tested against them. We may take patches in these areas if they make sense but
it is on a best effort only basis.
