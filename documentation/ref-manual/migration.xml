<title>Migrating to a Newer Yocto Project Release</title>

    <para>
        This chapter provides information you can use to migrate work to a
        newer Yocto Project release.  You can find the same information in the
        release notes for a given release.
    </para>

<section id='moving-to-the-yocto-project-1.3-release'>
    <title>Moving to the Yocto Project 1.3 Release</title>

    <para>
        This section provides migration information for moving to the
        Yocto Project 1.3 Release from the prior release.
    </para>

    <section id='1.3-local-configuration'>
        <title>Local Configuration</title>

        <para>
            Differences include changes for
            <link linkend='var-SSTATE_MIRRORS'><filename>SSTATE_MIRRORS</filename></link>
            and <filename>bblayers.conf</filename>.
        </para>

        <section id='migration-1.3-sstate-mirrors'>
            <title>SSTATE_MIRRORS</title>

            <para>
                The shared state cache (sstate-cache), as pointed to by
                <link linkend='var-SSTATE_DIR'><filename>SSTATE_DIR</filename></link>, by default
                now has two-character subdirectories to prevent issues rising
                from too many files in the same directory.
                Also, native sstate-cache packages will go into a subdirectory named using
                the distro ID string.
                If you copy the newly structured sstate-cache to a mirror location
                (either local or remote) and then point to it in
                <link linkend='var-SSTATE_MIRRORS'><filename>SSTATE_MIRRORS</filename></link>,
                you need to append "PATH" to the end of the mirror URL so that
                the path used by BitBake before the mirror substitution is
                appended to the path used to access the mirror.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SSTATE_MIRRORS = "file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH"
                </literallayout>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-bblayers-conf'>
            <title>bblayers.conf</title>

            <para>
                The <filename>meta-yocto</filename> layer consits of two parts
                that correspond to the Poky reference distribution and the
                reference hardware Board Support Packages (BSPs), respectively:
                <filename>meta-yocto</filename> and
                <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename>.
                When running BitBake or Hob for the first time after upgrading,
                your <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file will be
                updated to handle this change and you will be asked to
                re-run or restart for the changes to take effect.

    <section id='1.3-recipes'>
        <title>Recipes</title>

        <para>
            Differences include changes for the following:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Python function whitespace</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para><filename>proto=</filename> in <filename>SRC_URI</filename></para></listitem>

                <listitem><para>Removed recipes</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <section id='migration-1.3-python-function-whitespace'>
            <title>Python Function Whitespace</title>

            <para>
                All Python functions must now use four spaces for indentation.
                Previously, an inconsistent mix of spaces and tabs existed,
                which made extending these functions using
                <filename>_append</filename> or <filename>_prepend</filename>
                complicated given that Python treats whitespace as
                syntactically significant.
                If you are defining or extending any Python functions (e.g.
                <filename>populate_packages</filename>, <filename>do_unpack</filename>,
                <filename>do_patch</filename> and so forth) in custom recipes
                or classes, you need to ensure you are using consistent
                four-space indentation.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-proto=-in-src-uri'>
            <title>proto= in SRC_URI</title>

            <para>
                Any use of <filename>proto=</filename> in
                <link linkend='var-SRC_URI'><filename>SRC_URI</filename></link>
                needs to be changed to <filename>protocol=</filename>.
                In particular, this applies to the following URIs:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><filename>svn://</filename></para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><filename>bzr://</filename></para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><filename>hg://</filename></para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><filename>osc://</filename></para></listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                Other URIs were already using <filename>protocol=</filename>.
                This change improves consistency.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-nativesdk'>
            <title>nativesdk</title>

            <para>
                The suffix <filename>nativesdk</filename> is now implemented
                as a prefix, which simplifies a lot of the packaging code for
                <filename>nativesdk</filename> recipes.
                All custom <filename>nativesdk</filename> recipes and any
                references need to be updated to use
                <filename>nativesdk-*</filename> instead of
                <filename>*-nativesdk</filename>.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-task-recipes'>
            <title>Task Recipes</title>

            <para>
                "Task" recipes are now known as "Package groups" and have
                been renamed from <filename>task-*.bb</filename> to
                <filename>packagegroup-*.bb</filename>.
                Existing references to the previous <filename>task-*</filename>
                names should work in most cases as there is an automatic
                upgrade path for most packages.
                However, you should update references in your own recipes and
                configurations as they could be removed in future releases.
                You should also rename any custom <filename>task-*</filename>
                recipes to <filename>packagegroup-*</filename>, and change
                them to inherit <filename>packagegroup</filename> instead of
                <filename>task</filename>, as well as taking the opportunity
                to remove anything now handled by
                <filename>packagegroup.bbclass</filename>, such as providing
                <filename>-dev</filename> and <filename>-dbg</filename>
                packages, setting
                <link linkend='var-LIC_FILES_CHKSUM'><filename>LIC_FILES_CHKSUM</filename></link>,
                and so forth.
                See the
                "<link linkend='ref-classes-packagegroup'>Package Groups - packagegroup.bbclass</link>"
                section for further details.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-image-features'>
            <title>IMAGE_FEATURES</title>

            <para>
                Image recipes that previously included "apps-console-core"
                in <link linkend='var-IMAGE_FEATURES'><filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename></link>
                should now include "splash" instead to enable the boot-up
                splash screen.
                Retaining "apps-console-core" will still include the splash
                screen but generates a warning.
                The "apps-x11-core" and "apps-x11-games"
                <filename>IMAGE_FEATURES</filename> features have been removed.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section id='migration-1.3-removed-recipes'>
            <title>Removed Recipes</title>

            <para>
                The following recipes have been removed.
                For most of them, it is unlikely that you would have any
                references to them in your own
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>.
                However, you should check your metadata against this list to be sure:

                </itemizedlist>
                In addition to the previously listed changes, the
                <filename>meta-demoapps</filename> directory has also been removed
                because the recipes in it were not being maintained and many
                had become obsolete or broken.
                Additionally, these recipes were not parsed in the default configuration.
                Many of these recipes are already provided in an updated and
                maintained form within the OpenEmbedded community layers such as
                <filename>meta-oe</filename> and <filename>meta-gnome</filename>.
                For the remainder, you can now find them in the
                <filename>meta-extras</filename> repository, which is in the
                Yocto Project
