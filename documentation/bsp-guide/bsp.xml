        <title>Board Support Packages (BSP) - Developer's Guide</title>

        <para>
            A Board Support Package (BSP) is a collection of information that
            defines how to support a particular hardware device, set of devices, or
            hardware platform.
            The BSP includes information about the hardware features
            present on the device and kernel configuration information along with any
            additional hardware drivers required.
            The BSP also lists any additional software
            components required in addition to a generic Linux software stack for both
            essential and optional platform features.
        </para>

        <para>
            This guide presents information about BSP Layers, defines a structure for components
            so that BSPs follow a commonly understood layout, discusses how to customize
            a recipe for a BSP, addresses BSP licensing, and provides information that
            shows you how to create and manage a

            <title>BSP Layers</title>

            <para>
                A BSP consists of a file structure inside a base directory.
                Collectively, you can think of the base directory, its file structure,
                and the contents as a BSP Layer.
                Although not a strict requirement, BSP layers in the Yocto Project
                use the following well-established naming convention:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-<replaceable>bsp_name</replaceable>
                </literallayout>
                The string "meta-" is prepended to the machine or platform name, which is
                <replaceable>bsp_name</replaceable> in the above form.
                <note><title>Tip</title>
                    Because the BSP layer naming convention is well-established,
                    it is advisable to follow it when creating layers.
                    Technically speaking, a BSP layer name does not need to
                    start with <filename>meta-</filename>.
                    However, various scripts and tools in the Yocto Project
                    development environment assume this convention.
                </note>
            </para>

            <para>
                To help understand the BSP layer concept, consider the BSPs that the
                Yocto Project supports and provides with each release.
                You can see the layers in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_GS_URL;#yocto-project-repositories'>Yocto Project Source Repositories</ulink>
                through a web interface at
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;/cgit/cgit.cgi'></ulink>.
                If you go to that interface, you will find a list of repositories
                under "Yocto Metadata Layers".
                <note>
                    Layers that are no longer actively supported as part of the
                    Yocto Project appear under the heading "Yocto Metadata Layer
                    Archive."
                </note>
                Each repository is a BSP layer supported by the Yocto Project
                (e.g. <filename>meta-raspberrypi</filename> and
                <filename>meta-intel</filename>).
                Each of these layers is a repository unto itself and clicking on a
                layer reveals information that includes two links from which you can choose
                to set up a clone of the layer's repository on your local host system.
                Here is an example that clones the Raspberry Pi BSP layer:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                In addition to BSP layers, the
                <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename> layer is part of the
                shipped <filename>poky</filename> repository.
                The <filename>meta-yocto-bsp</filename> layer maintains several
                BSPs such as the Beaglebone, EdgeRouter, and generic versions of
                both 32-bit and 64-bit IA machines.
            </para>

                section also in the Yocto Project Development Tasks Manual.
            </para>

            <para>
                The layer's base directory
                (<filename>meta-<replaceable>bsp_name</replaceable></filename>)
                is the root of the BSP Layer.
                This root is what you add to the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-BBLAYERS'><filename>BBLAYERS</filename></ulink>
                variable in the <filename>conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file found in the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>,
                which is established after you run the OpenEmbedded build environment
                setup script (i.e.
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-core-script'><filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename></ulink>).
                Adding the root allows the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>
                to recognize the BSP layer and from it build an image.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBLAYERS ?= " \
       /usr/local/src/yocto/meta \
       /usr/local/src/yocto/meta-poky \
       /usr/local/src/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
       /usr/local/src/yocto/meta-mylayer \
       "
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                Some BSPs require additional layers on
                top of the BSP's root layer in order to be functional.
                For these cases, you also need to add those layers to the
                <filename>BBLAYERS</filename> variable in order to build the BSP.
                You must also specify in the "Dependencies" section of the BSP's
                <filename>README</filename> file any requirements for additional
                layers and, preferably, any
                build instructions that might be contained elsewhere
                in the <filename>README</filename> file.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some layers function as a layer to hold other BSP layers.
                An example of this type of layer is the
                <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer.
                This layer contains BSP layers for the Intel-core2-32
                <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark> Common Core
                (Intel-core2-32) and the Intel-corei7-64
                <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark> Common Core
                (Intel-corei7-64).
                the <filename>meta-intel</filename> layer also contains
                the <filename>common/</filename> directory, which contains
                common content across those layers.

                        their own layers or in layers designed to contain several
                        BSPs.
                        To get an idea of machine support through BSP layers, you can

            <para>
                Defining a common BSP directory structure allows
                end-users to understand and become familiar with
                that standard.
                A common format also encourages standardization
                of software support for hardware.
            </para>

            <para>
                The proposed form described in this section does
                have elements that are specific to the OpenEmbedded
                build system.
                It is intended that developers can use this structure
                with other build systems besides the OpenEmbedded build
                system.
                It is also intended that it will be be simple to extract
                information and convert it to other formats if required.
                The OpenEmbedded build system, through its standard
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_GS_URL;#the-yocto-project-layer-model'>layers mechanism</ulink>,
                can directly accept the format described as a layer.
                The BSP layer captures all the hardware-specific details
                in one place using a standard format, which is useful
                for any person wishing to use the hardware platform
                regardless of the build system they are using.
            </para>

            <para>
                The BSP specification does not include a build system
                or other tools - the specification is concerned with
                the hardware-specific components only.
                At the end-distribution point, you can ship the BSP
                layer combined with a build system and other tools.
                Realize that it is important to maintain the distinction
                that the BSP layer, a build system, and tools are
                separate components that could to be combined in
                certain end products.
            </para>

            <para>
                Before looking at the common form for the file structure
                inside a BSP Layer, you should be aware that some
                requirements do exist in order for a BSP layer to
                be considered compliant with the Yocto Project.
                For that list of requirements, see the
                "<link linkend='released-bsp-requirements'>Released BSP Requirements</link>"
                section.
            </para>

            <para>
                Below is the common form for the file structure
                inside a BSP Layer.
                While this basic form represents the standard,
                realize that the actual file structures for specific
                BSPs could differ.

                    The type or types of files here can vary depending
                    on the licensing requirements.
                    For example, in the Raspberry Pi BSP all licensing
                    requirements are handled with the

                    This optional area contains useful pre-built kernels
                    and user-space filesystem images released with the
                    BSP that are appropriate to the target system.
                    This directory typically contains graphical (e.g. Sato)
                    and minimal live images when the BSP tarball has been
                    created and made available in the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;'>Yocto Project</ulink>
                    website.
                    You can use these kernels and images to get a system
                    running and quickly get started on development tasks.

                    The machine files bind together all the information
                    contained elsewhere in the BSP into a format that
                    the build system can understand.
                    Each BSP Layer requires at least one machine file.
                    If the BSP supports multiple machines, multiple
                    machine configuration files can exist.
                    These filenames correspond to the values to which

                    This configuration file could also include a hardware
                    "tuning" file that is commonly used to define the
                    package architecture and specify optimization flags,
                    which are carefully chosen to give best performance

                    This optional directory contains miscellaneous recipe
                    files for the BSP.
                    Most notably would be the formfactor files.
                    For example, in the Raspberry Pi BSP there is the
                    <filename>formfactor_0.0.bbappend</filename> file,
                    which is an append file used to augment the recipe
                    that starts the build.
                    Furthermore, there are machine-specific settings used
                    during the build that are defined by the
                    <filename>machconfig</filename> file further down in
                    the directory.
                    Here is the <filename>machconfig</filename> file for
                    the Raspberry Pi BSP:

                        Layers are ideal for isolating and storing work for a
                        given piece of hardware.
                        A layer is really just a location or area in which you
                        place the recipes and configurations for your BSP.
                        In fact, a BSP is, in itself, a special type of layer.
                        The simplest way to create a new BSP layer that is
                        compliant with the Yocto Project is to use the
                        <filename>yocto-bsp</filename> script.
                        For information about that script, see the
                        "<link linkend='creating-a-new-bsp-layer-using-the-bitbake-layers-script'>Creating a New BSP Layer Using the yocto-bsp Script</link>"
                        section.</para>

                        <para>Another example that illustrates a layer
                        is an application.
                        Suppose you are creating an application that has
                        library or other dependencies in order for it to
                        compile and run.
                        The layer, in this case, would be where all the
                        recipes that define those dependencies are kept.
                        The key point for a layer is that it is an isolated
                        area that contains all the relevant information for
                        the project that the OpenEmbedded build system knows
                        about.

                            These configuration files define machine targets that can be built
                            using the BSP layer.
                            Multiple machine configuration files define variations of machine
                            configurations that are supported by the BSP.
                            If a BSP supports multiple machine variations, you need to
                            adequately describe each variation in the BSP
                            <filename>README</filename> file.
                            Do not use multiple machine configuration files to describe disparate
                            hardware.
                            If you do have very different targets, you should create separate
                            BSP layers for each target.
                            <note>It is completely possible for a developer to structure the

                <para>
                    Following are recommendations for a released BSP that conforms to the

                            can contain one or more bootable images.
                            Including bootable images allows users to easily try out the BSP

                            In this case, you might want to make two versions of the
                            BSP available: one that contains binary images, and one
                            that does not.
                            The version that does not contain bootable images avoids
                            unnecessary download times for users not interested in the images.

                       have that additional hierarchy and the files would obviously not be
                       able to reside in a machine-specific directory.

               Following is a specific example to help you better understand the process.
               Consider an example that customizes a recipe by adding

               <filename>init-ifupdown_1.0.bb</filename> recipe for machine "xyz" where the
               BSP layer also supports several other machines.
               Do the following:
               <orderedlist>
                   <listitem><para>Edit the <filename>init-ifupdown_1.0.bbappend</filename> file so that it

                       </para></listitem>

                In some cases, a BSP contains separately licensed Intellectual Property (IP)
                for a component or components.
                For these cases, you are required to accept the terms of a commercial or other
                type of license that requires some kind of explicit End User License Agreement (EULA).
                Once the license is accepted, the OpenEmbedded build system can then build and
                include the corresponding component in the final BSP image.
                If the BSP is available as a pre-built image, you can download the image after
                agreeing to the license or EULA.
            </para>

            <para>
                You could find that some separately licensed components that are essential
                for normal operation of the system might not have an unencumbered (or free)
                substitute.
                Without these essential components, the system would be non-functional.
                Then again, you might find that other licensed components that are simply
                'good-to-have' or purely elective do have an unencumbered, free replacement
                component that you can use rather than agreeing to the separately licensed component.
                Even for components essential to the system, you might find an unencumbered component
                that is not identical but will work as a less-capable version of the
                licensed version in the BSP recipe.
            </para>

            <para>
                For cases where you can substitute a free component and still
                maintain the system's functionality, the "Downloads" page from the
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;'>Yocto Project website's</ulink>
                makes available de-featured BSPs
                that are completely free of any IP encumbrances.
                For these cases, you can use the substitution directly and
                without any further licensing requirements.
                If present, these fully de-featured BSPs are named appropriately
                different as compared to the names of the respective
                encumbered BSPs.
                If available, these substitutions are your
                simplest and most preferred options.
                Use of these substitutions of course assumes the resulting functionality meets
                system requirements.
            </para>

            <para>
                If however, a non-encumbered version is unavailable or
                it provides unsuitable functionality or quality, you can use an encumbered
                version.
            </para>

            <para>
                A couple different methods exist within the OpenEmbedded build system to
                satisfy the licensing requirements for an encumbered BSP.
                The following list describes them in order of preference:
	        <orderedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Use the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE_FLAGS'><filename>LICENSE_FLAGS</filename></ulink>
                        variable to define the recipes that have commercial or other
                        types of specially-licensed packages:</emphasis>
                        For each of those recipes, you can
                        specify a matching license string in a
                        <filename>local.conf</filename> variable named
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST'><filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename></ulink>.
                        Specifying the matching license string signifies that you agree to the license.
                        Thus, the build system can build the corresponding recipe and include
                        the component in the image.
                        See the
                        "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_CM_URL;#enabling-commercially-licensed-recipes'>Enabling Commercially Licensed Recipes</ulink>"
                        section in the Yocto Project Concepts Manual for details on how
                        to use these variables.</para>
                        <para>If you build as you normally would, without
		        specifying any recipes in the

		        provides you with the list of recipes that you have
		        tried to include in the image that need entries in
		        the <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename>.
		        Once you enter the appropriate license flags into the whitelist,
		        restart the build to continue where it left off.
		        During the build, the prompt will not appear again
		        since you have satisfied the requirement.</para>
                        <para>Once the appropriate license flags are on the white list
		        in the <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename> variable, you
		        can build the encumbered image with no change at all
		        to the normal build process.</para></listitem>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Get a pre-built version of the BSP:</emphasis>
                        You can get this type of BSP by visiting the
                        "Downloads" page of the
                        <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;'>Yocto Project website</ulink>.
                        You can download BSP tarballs that contain proprietary components
                        after agreeing to the licensing
                        requirements of each of the individually encumbered
                        packages as part of the download process.
                        Obtaining the BSP this way allows you to access an encumbered
                        image immediately after agreeing to the
                        click-through license agreements presented by the
                        website.
                        Note that if you want to build the image
                        yourself using the recipes contained within the BSP
                        tarball, you will still need to create an
                        appropriate <filename>LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST</filename> to match the
                        encumbered recipes in the BSP.</para></listitem>

            </para>

            <note>
                Pre-compiled images are bundled with
                a time-limited kernel that runs for a
                predetermined amount of time (10 days) before it forces
                the system to reboot.
                This limitation is meant to discourage direct redistribution
                of the image.
                You must eventually rebuild the image if you want to remove this restriction.

            <para>
                The Yocto Project includes a couple of tools that enable
                you to create a <link linkend='bsp-layers'>BSP layer</link>
                from scratch and do basic configuration and maintenance
                of the kernel without ever looking at a Metadata file.
                These tools are <filename>yocto-bsp</filename> and <filename>yocto-kernel</filename>,
                respectively.
	    </para>

            <para>
                The following sections describe the common location and help features as well

                <para>
                    Designed to have a  command interface somewhat like
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_GS_URL;#git'>Git</ulink>, each
                    tool is structured as a set of sub-commands under a
                    top-level command.
                    The top-level command (<filename>yocto-bsp</filename>
                    or <filename>yocto-kernel</filename>) itself does
                    nothing but invoke or provide help on the sub-commands
                    it supports.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Both tools reside in the <filename>scripts/</filename> subdirectory

                    Consequently, to use the scripts, you must <filename>source</filename> the
                    environment just as you would when invoking a build:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ source oe-init-build-env <replaceable>build_dir</replaceable>
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    The most immediately useful function is to get help on both tools.
                    The built-in help system makes it easy to drill down at
                    any time and view the syntax required for any specific command.
                    Simply enter the name of the command with the <filename>help</filename>
                    switch:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-bsp help
     Usage:

      Create a customized Yocto BSP layer.

      usage: yocto-bsp [--version] [--help] COMMAND [ARGS]

      Current 'yocto-bsp' commands are:

      See 'yocto-bsp help COMMAND' for more information on a specific command.


     Options:

                <para>
                    Similarly, entering just the name of a sub-command shows the detailed usage
                    for that sub-command:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-bsp create

     Usage:

            [-i &lt;JSON PROPERTY FILE&gt; | --infile &lt;JSON PROPERTY_FILE&gt;]

      This command creates a Yocto BSP based on the specified parameters.
      The new BSP will be a new Yocto BSP layer contained by default within
      the top-level directory specified as 'meta-bsp-name'.  The -o option
      can be used to place the BSP layer in a directory with a different
      name and location.

      The value of the 'karch' parameter determines the set of files that
      will be generated for the BSP, along with the specific set of
      'properties' that will be used to fill out the BSP-specific portions
      of the BSP.  The possible values for the 'karch' parameter can be
      listed via 'yocto-bsp list karch'.

                    For any sub-command, you can use the word "help" option just before the

     NAME
         yocto-bsp create - Create a new Yocto BSP

     SYNOPSIS
         yocto-bsp create &lt;bsp-name> &lt;karch&gt; [-o &lt;DIRNAME&gt; | --outdir &lt;DIRNAME&gt;]
             [-i &lt;JSON PROPERTY FILE&gt; | --infile &lt;JSON PROPERTY_FILE&gt;]

     DESCRIPTION
         This command creates a Yocto BSP based on the specified
         parameters.  The new BSP will be a new Yocto BSP layer contained
         by default within the top-level directory specified as
         'meta-bsp-name'.  The -o option can be used to place the BSP layer
         in a directory with a different name and location.

                    Now that you know where these two commands reside and how to access information
                    on them, you should find it relatively straightforward to discover the commands
                    necessary to create a BSP and perform basic kernel maintenance on that BSP using
                    the tools.
                    <note>
                        You can also use the <filename>bitbake-layers</filename> script to create
                        a "generic" layer.
                        For information on using this script to create a layer, see the

                <para>
                    The remainder of this section presents an example that uses
                    <filename>myarm</filename> as the machine name and <filename>qemu</filename>
                    as the machine architecture.
                    Of the available architectures, <filename>qemu</filename> is the only architecture
                    that causes the script to prompt you further for an actual architecture.
                    In every other way, this architecture is representative of how creating a BSP for
                    an actual machine would work.
                    The reason the example uses this architecture is because it is an emulated architecture
                    and can easily be followed without requiring actual hardware.

                    [ASSUMING SIMLILAR ACTION OCCURS]As the [SUBCOMMAND] command runs, default values for
                    the prompts appear in brackets.
                    Pressing enter without supplying anything on the command line or pressing enter
                    with an invalid response causes the script to accept the default value.
                    Once the script completes, the new <filename>meta-myarm</filename> BSP layer
                    is created in the current working directory.
                    This example assumes you have sourced the
                    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#structure-core-script'><filename>&OE_INIT_FILE;</filename></ulink>

                            the script first prompts you for which emulated architecture to use.
                            In the example, we use the ARM architecture.

                        <listitem><para>The script then prompts you for the kernel.
                            The default 4.8 kernel is acceptable.
                            So, the example accepts the default.
                            If you enter 'n', the script prompts you to further enter the kernel
                            you do want to use.</para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para>Next, the script asks whether you would like to have a new
                            branch created especially for your BSP in the local

                            If not, then the script re-uses an existing branch.</para>
                            <para>In this example, the default (or "yes") is accepted.
                            Thus, a new branch is created for the BSP rather than using a common, shared
                            branch.
                            The new branch is the branch committed to for any patches you might later add.
                            The reason a new branch is the default is that typically
                            new BSPs do require BSP-specific patches.
                            The tool thus assumes that most of time a new branch is required.

                            (or to re-use if you had elected to not create a new branch).
                            Because this example is generating an ARM-based BSP, the example
                            uses <filename>#1</filename> at the prompt, which selects the ARM-versatile branch.

                    Once the BSP Layer is created, you must add it to your

                    Here is an example:

                    </literallayout>
                    Adding the layer to this file allows the build system to build the BSP and
                    find the layer along with other Metadata it needs.

                    The <filename>yocto-kernel</filename> script allows you to add, remove, and list patches

                    All you need to do is use the appropriate sub-command.
                    Recall that the easiest way to see exactly what sub-commands are available
                    is to use the <filename>yocto-kernel</filename> built-in help as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel --help

                <para>
                    The <filename>yocto-kernel patch add</filename> sub-command allows you to add a
                    patch to a BSP.
                    The following example adds two patches to the <filename>myarm</filename> BSP:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel patch add myarm ~/test.patch
     Added patches:
       test.patch

     $ yocto-kernel patch add myarm ~/yocto-testmod.patch
     Added patches:
       yocto-testmod.patch
                    </literallayout>
                    <note>Although the previous example adds patches one at a time, it is possible
                    to add multiple patches at the same time.</note>
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can verify patches have been added by using the
                    <filename>yocto-kernel patch list</filename> sub-command.
                    Here is an example:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel patch list myarm
     The current set of machine-specific patches for myarm is:
       1) test.patch
       2) yocto-testmod.patch
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can also use the <filename>yocto-kernel</filename> script to
                    remove a patch using the <filename>yocto-kernel patch rm</filename> sub-command.
                    Here is an example:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel patch rm myarm
     Specify the patches to remove:
       1) test.patch
       2) yocto-testmod.patch
     1
     Removed patches:
       test.patch
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    Again, using the <filename>yocto-kernel patch list</filename> sub-command,
                    you can verify that the patch was in fact removed:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel patch list myarm
     The current set of machine-specific patches for myarm is:
       1) yocto-testmod.patch
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    In a completely similar way, you can use the <filename>yocto-kernel config add</filename>
                    sub-command to add one or more kernel config item settings to a BSP.
                    The following commands add a couple of config items to the
                    <filename>myarm</filename> BSP:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel config add myarm CONFIG_MISC_DEVICES=y
     Added item:
       CONFIG_MISC_DEVICES=y

     $ yocto-kernel config add myarm CONFIG_YOCTO_TESTMOD=y
     Added item:
       CONFIG_YOCTO_TESTMOD=y
                    </literallayout>
                    <note>
                        Although the previous example adds config items one at a time, it is possible
                        to add multiple config items at the same time.
                    </note>
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can list the config items now associated with the BSP.
                    Doing so shows you the config items you added as well as others associated
                    with the BSP:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ yocto-kernel config list myarm
     The current set of machine-specific kernel config items for myarm is:
             1) CONFIG_MISC_DEVICES=y
             2) CONFIG_YOCTO_TESTMOD=y
                    </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, you can remove one or more config items using the
                    <filename>yocto-kernel config rm</filename> sub-command in a manner
                    completely analogous to <filename>yocto-kernel patch rm</filename>.
